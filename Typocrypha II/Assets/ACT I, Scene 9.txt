Narrator: You,{pm} Dahlia,{pm} and Esaias travel through the Ruins.


>addchar,Illyia,0,0,right,concerned


Narrator: ...with Illyia about 20 feet ahead,{pm} keeping her distance.


Illyia(concerned): .{pl}.{pl}.


Dahlia(normal): Illyia!{pm} Hold up!


Illyia(ashamed): What do you want,{pm} Bob Cut?


Dahlia(stressed): B-Bob Cut!?{pm} I-{pm} ^shake^Urgh!|shake|


Dahlia(perish): {c,whisper}Deep breaths,{pm} Dahlia...{c}


>movechar,Dahlia,right,top


Dahlia(happy): I think we maybe got off on the wrong foot.


Dahlia: I get it,{pm} you’re from the Xiong family,{ps} right?


>setexpr,Illyia,serious


Narrator: Illyia furrows her brow.


Illyia: ...so what?


Dahlia(normal): You’ve probably been fighting demons from the day you learned how to type.


Dahlia(concerned): But the Ruins are dangerous! 


Dahlia: It’ll be safer if we stick together.


Dahlia(laughing): Right,{ps} leader?


Ayin(surprised): Huh?


Ayin(nervoussmile): Oh,{pm} uh,{ps} yeah! 


Esaias(lookingleft): Actually,{pm} as long as we follow the planned route,{pm} I would imagine a Typocrypha user as skilled as Illyia would have little trouble.


Dahlia(perish): Esaias!


Esaias(embarrassed): Oh...!


Esaias(anxious): Well,{pm} u-um,{pm} it would also reflect poorly on your performance rating to go against the wishes of your team leader.


Esaias(lookingleft): Especially for someone on observation,{pm} I would advise some prudence in your actions.


Ayin(ohfuck): {c,whisper}(Wait,{pm} we’re being graded?){c}


Illyia(ashamed): ...fine.


>setexpr,Ayin,serious


Illyia(concerned): I’ll stick around.{pm} For now... 


Illyia(serious): Just don’t get in my way,{ps} OK?


Dahlia(laughing): See?{pm} It’s no so bad when-


Illyia(ashamed): -you can stop that,{ps} you know.


Dahlia(normal): ...stop what?


Illyia: The whole friendly act. 


Illyia(serious): We’re at war,{ps} if you haven’t noticed.


Illyia(ashamed): Why’d you even volunteer for this clusterfuck of an operation?


Illyia(normal): What,{pm} hoping to show off and make a quick buck?


Dahlia(perish):...!


>stopbgm


Narrator: Dahlia suddenly stops walking.


Dahlia(serious): ...I could ask the same of you.


Dahlia: I’m sure a Xiong like you could’ve easily gotten onto the Attack Team if they wanted.


Dahlia(Happy): Oh wait,{pm} that’s right,{pm} you’re currently on “observation” and probably got thrown onto the scouting teams as punishment!


Illyia(pissed): ...!?


Illyia(serious): You don’t know shit.


>playbgm,BGMExposition


Dahlia(stressed): Oh I know plenty! 


Dahlia: We’ve been in the same team for less than an hour and I know you’re arrogant{ps} and don’t know how to work with a team!


Narrator: Illyia and Dahlia continue to go back and forth,{pm} their yells echoing off the Ruins walls.


Ayin(nervous): {c,whisper}(D-Do I need to do something about this?){c}


Ayin(nervoussmile): U-Uh,{pm} hey,{pm} maybe we shouldn’t-


Dahlia(perish): And you know what else?{pm} What’s wrong with your Typocrypha!?{pm} It’s just a sword[a]!


Illyia[action](yell): Well maybe if you’d studied a little more combat theory,{pm} you’d know the sword is the most efficient Spell weapon!


>setexpr,Ayin,ohfuck


Dahlia(stressed): What does that even mean!?


Dahlia(perish): Can you even type at 60[b]???


Illyia[base](serious): How DARE you...


Narrator: You desperately look towards Esaias,{pm} powerless to do anything about the situation.


>stopbgm


Esaias(embarrassed): U-Uh,{ps} um!!


Esaias: The reason why I volunteered was because I wanted to see the Ruins!


>setexpr,Dahlia,normal


Illyia: .{pl}.{pl}.


Esaias(embarrassed): I-{ps}I was just answering your previous question...


Dahlia: .{pl}.{pl}.


Ayin: .{pl}.{pl}.


Illyia(ashamed): I...


Illyia(concerned): Fine,{pm} yeah sure,{pm} whatever.


Illyia(serious): Why don’t you start navigating us then,{pm} Mr. Sightseer. 


>playbgm,BGMAgarthanRuins


Esaias: Yes,{ps} of course.


Esaias(normal): The current tunnel we are in will take us all the way to the inner levels where the First Barrier is most likely to be located.


Esaias(lookingright): The tunnel itself is isolated from the main atrium,{pm} and as such we should meet virtually no Demon resistance-


>stopbgm


Illyia(serious): -Shh!


Narrator: Illyia suddenly pulls the party into a nearby alcove.


Narrator: Peering deeper into the hall,{pm} you see a group of Demons guarding the passage.


Illyia(ashamed): Well so much for your plan.


Esaias(anxious): No...{pm} This does not make sense.


Dahlia(stressed): They must’ve been alerted by the...{pm} noise we were making...


Dahlia(concerned): Is there another path we can take?


Esaias(lookingright): Due to the isolated nature of this tunnel,{pm} there are few other options than to backtrack if we wish to avoid the Demons.


Illyia(normal): I think I have a better idea.


>playbgm,BGMBattleNormal2


Illyia[action](yell): Engaging!


Dahlia(stressed): Wai-


>removechar,Illyia


Narrator: You helplessly watch Illyia charge towards the Demons.


Dahlia(perish): Argh!{pm} She’s so infuriating! 


Dahlia(serious): We have to back her up!{pm} C’mon!


Ayin(ohfuck):{c,whisper}(I was hoping you wouldn’t say that...){c}

[a]maybe a little weird having goofy argument
[b]shorthand for '60 wpm' - maybe can even add a tips entry to clarify if not clear
