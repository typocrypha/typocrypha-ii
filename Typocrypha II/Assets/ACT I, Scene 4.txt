Adelai[0,2](bffs4ever): See,{pm} you’re doing fine!


Adelai[0,2](normal): You should also start looking out for opportunities to {c,ui-terms}Counter{c} enemy Spells!


Ayin[0,1]: {c,ui-terms}Counter{c}?


Adelai(normal)[0,2]: Whenever you see an enemy casting a {c,ui-terms}Spell{c} that you also have,{pm} try hitting them with it!


Adelai[0,2]: Like those Tanukis! 


Tanuki[1,1]: Feel the pointy wrath of my {c,highlight}LANCE{c} Spell!


Adelai[0,2]: When they start charging up a {c,highlight}LANCE{c} Spell,{pm} use your own {c,ui-terms}LANCE{c} to counter them!

Adelai(serious)[0,2]: Pro-tip:{pm} If you see a Spell you can normally cast not highlighted in {c,highlight}Orange{c},{pm} it probably means the Spell is on Cooldown!
