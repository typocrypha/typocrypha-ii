Narrator: The party arrives at a four-way fork in the tunnel.


Narrator: Esaias pauses to look down at his map,{pm} perplexed.


>setexpr,Ayin,serious


Esaias(anxious): Based on my maps,{pm} one of these paths should lead us further into the Ruins...


Illyia(concerned): And let me guess,{pm} you don’t know which one.


Esaias(embarrassed): N-No...


Illyia(ashamed): Of course you don’t,{pm} why’d I even bother asking?


Dahlia(stressed): Hey,{pm} don’t lash out at Esaias!


Dahlia(sarcastic): Not like you know which way to go!


Illyia(normal): But I do know how to find out.


Illyia(quietlyhappy): Four doors and four people -{pm} you do the math.


Illyia: We split up and report back here in 30 minutes.


Dahlia(serious): We can’t do that!{pm} What if there are more Demons?


Illyia(serious): Then you handle them. 


Illyia: We’re all soldiers,{pm} aren’t we?


>setexpr,Ayin,ohfuck


Narrator: Illyia shoots you a nasty look.


>setexpr,Ayin,serious


Dahlia(concerned): Esaias,{pm} what do you think?


Esaias(lookingleft): .{pl}.{pl}.


>setexpr,Ayin,serious


Esaias(normal): I agree with Illyia.


Esaias(anxious): If I only had a little more data on the paths ahead,{pm} I should be able to deduce the correct path forward.


Esaias(normal): 30,{pm} no...{pm} 15 minutes of scouting down each path should be more than enough to get a sense of the layout.


Illyia(normal): See?{pm} Our Navigator seems to agree!


Dahlia(concerned): I’m still against this,{pm} we’ve run into so many Demons already.


Ayin: .{pl}.{pl}.


Ayin(nervous): I-I think we should split up too.


Dahlia(serious): Are you sure,{ps} Ayin?{pm} I could go with you-


Illyia(normal): Ah,{pm} our “Brave Captain” can handle themselves,{pm} right?


Ayin(nervoussmile): Y-Yeah...


Ayin(normal): Thanks Dahlia,{pm} but it’s just a short scouting trip,{ps} right?


Ayin(nervous): A-And if something happens,{pm} I can always just run back here...


Esaias(normal): Actually,{pm} for the purposes of data collection,{pm} it would be better if you could fight the Demons to continue...


Ayin(ohfuck): {c,whisper}(gulp...!){c}


Illyia(laughing): Alright,{pm} then it’s decided!


Illyia(normal): It’s now 13:35,{pm} so we’ll meet back here at 13:50 on the dot.


Illyia: Off we go!


>removechar,Illyia


Dahlia(concerned): Ayin,{pm} just be careful,{ps} OK?

Esaias(lookingleft): Best of luck,{pm} Ayin.

Narrator: As each of your party members leave,{pm} you start to feel the initial pinpricks of anxiety creep up on you.


Narrator: Taking deep breaths,{pm} you head into your own tunnel.

NarratorSilent: Armed with only the narrow flashlight on your Typocrypha,{pm} you inch down the corridor.


NarratorSilent(center): “Just a short scouting trip.”


NarratorSilent: These words become your mantra,{pm} spoken under your breath with each shaky exhale.


NarratorSilent: But with every step,{pm} you come closer to a stark realization.


NarratorSilent: This whole mission was supposed to be “just a short scouting trip.”


NarratorSilent: And now look where you are.

NarratorSilent[middle](left): You’re alone...


NarratorSilent[middle](center): ...in the dark...


NarratorSilent[middle](right): ...with Demons everywhere.

NarratorSilent: You check your clock -{pm} 13:37.


NarratorSilent: Has it really only been 2 minutes?


NarratorSilent: Did 15 minutes always feel this long?


NarratorSilent: You quicken your pace as if to move faster through this eternity.


NarratorSilent: Spotlight bouncing chaotically between the walls and floor.


NarratorSilent: You go faster,{pm} and faster,{ps} and faster and faster and-

Ayin(surprisedbad): N-Niya?

Narrator: Standing before you is Niya,{pm} your twin.


Narrator: They glare at you menacingly.


Narrator: It’s a look you’re all too familiar with.


Niya: .{pl}.{pl}. 


Ayin(nervous): .{pl}.{pl}.


Niya: What?{pm} No hello?

Ayin(ohfuck): H-How’re you,{pm} Niya?


Narrator: Niya squints at you,{pm} and lets out a sigh.


Niya: I’m fine[b].


Niya: Anyways,{pm} are we going to do this?


Ayin(surprisedbad): W-What?

Narrator: Niya pulls down their mask over their [c]face...


Narrator: ...and takes out their weapon,{pm} a strange-looking Typocrypha,{pm} aiming it directly at you.
