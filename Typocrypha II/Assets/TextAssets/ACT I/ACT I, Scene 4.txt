Adelai[0,2]: After you use a spell it goes on {c,ui-terms}cooldown.{c}


Adelai[0,2]: You’ll have to {c,ui-terms}use different spells{c} until it recharges.


Adelai[0,2]: Just keep using whatever’s highlighted in your {c,ui-terms}Spell List{c}--it should be located at the {c,ui-terms}bottom left of your Typocrypha interface.{c}

Adelai(serious): Ayin! What are you doing?


Ayin(uncomfortable): I’m sorry I-


Adelai(serious): Move out of the way!

Adelai[0,2]: SWORD!


// TODO: Changeling takes damage.


Adelai[0,2]: Ayin, you have to {c,ui-terms}type the spells{c} into your Typocrypha! Remember?


Adelai[0,2]: In the {c,ui-terms}bottom left of your Typocrypha interface{c} is your {c,ui-terms}Spell List.{c}


Adelai[0,2]: Try typing in the spell “PUNCH” and then {c,ui-terms}press enter{c} to cast the spell!


// TODO: Waits for player to cast a spell. Enemy is paused in meantime.

Ayin(nervous): There’s more of them!


Adelai(serious): You’ll have to use the targeting functionality of your Typocrypha, Ayin!


+bubble


Adelai[0,2]: {c,ui-terms}Use the arrow keys to move your target cursor{c} to one of those demons.


Adelai[0,2]: Your spells only hit a single target, so you’ll have to beat them separately.

//After defeating one of the changelings:

Adelai[0,2]: Good work, Ayin!


Adelai[0,2]: Now retarget and finish off the other one!


Adelai[0,2]: If it’s easier, you can also use the {c,ui-terms}tab key to cycle through targets.{c}

Adelai(frustrated): Um, hey Ayin? I know these demons aren’t very strong, but...


Adelai(teasing): Shouldn’t you use more spells than just PUNCH and KICK?


Ayin(concerned): Wait, aren’t those the only ones I have?


Adelai(serious): What.


Adelai(caring): ... OH! Ayin you still have your Typocrypha on CIVILIAN mode!


Adelai: Here, let me just...

Clarke[0,1]: Typocrypha mode switch: BATTLE mode.


Adelai[0,2]: There!


Ayin[0,1]: W-Woah! What do all these spells do?


Adelai[0,2]: No time to explain! Just keep typing!!

Adelai(bffs4ever): See, you’re doing fine!


Adelai(normal): Now that you have more spells, you can start looking out for opportunities to {c,ui-terms}Counter{c} enemy spells!


Ayin(surprised): Counter?


+bubble


Adelai[0,2]: Whenever you see an enemy casting a spell that you also have, try hitting them with it!


Adelai[0,2]: Like those Tanukis! When they start charging up a {c,ui-terms}LANCE{c} spell, use your own {c,ui-terms}LANCE{c} to stagger them!


Adelai[0,2]: Your Typocrypha should highlight those opportunities in {c,highlight}Orange{c}, so just keep a lookout!


>end
//When an enemy is stunned
>start,ACT-I-4-4-Stun


+bubble


Adelai[0,2]: You {c,ui-terms}stunned{c} that demon, Ayin!


Adelai[0,2]: Whenever you counter a demon or hit it with a weakness, it’ll get {c,ui-terms}staggered.{c}


Adelai[0,2]: Keep on {c,ui-terms}staggering{c} a demon, and eventually you’ll {c,ui-terms}stun{c} them!


Adelai[0,2]: {c,ui-terms}Stunned demons can’t use spells for a while{c}, leaving them open to attack!


Adelai[0,2]: In your Typocrypha HUD, you can see how many times you have to stagger a demon to stun them in the {c,ui-terms}Shield icon.{c}


Adelai[0,2]: Keeping your enemy stunned is a great way to do damage and also to protect yourself!

Adelai[0,2]: I think this is the last of them! 


Adelai[0,2]: They’ll start swarming us out of desperation, so just keep taking them down!
