Narrator: Captain’s log - Scouting Team Z - 13:32, 3 hours since start of operation.


>playbgm,BGMBirdPeople


Narrator: We have progressed halfway through the Ruins towards where we believe the First Barrier is.


Narrator: There has been a larger Demon presence than expected, however we have so far had no major casualties.


Narrator: ...


Ayin: ...


Ayin(ohfuck): (What else do I write in these things? Uh...)


>setexpr,Ayin,serious


Narrator: Team morale is high.

>setexpr,Ayin,nervous


Dahlia(stressed): Hey, Illyia! That was my ration!


Illyia(pissed): I’m the Forward Guard, you’re just the Medic! I burn more calories than you!


>setexpr,Ayin,ohfuck


Narrator: Team morale is OK.[b]


>setexpr,Ayin,serious


Narrator: The team remains focused on our goal to find the First Barrier.


>addchar,Esaias,0,0,left,normal


Esaias(normal): Ayin, look!


Ayin(surprisedbad): Wh-What is it Esaias? Is it more Demons-


Esaias(embarrassed): The writing on these tablets are of a quality I have never seen before! If I had to hazard a guess, these were markers used by the Obscurians to help guide them through the Ruins. Of course, the directions needed to be quite complex for...[c]


Ayin(concerned): ...


Narrator: As Captain, I have faith that our team will be able to find the First Barrier as long as we stick together-


>stopbgm


Illyia(serious): Alright team, looks like it’s time for us to split up.


Ayin(uncomfortable): H-Huh?


>playbgm,BGMAgarthanRuins


Narrator: You look up from your Typocrypha to see the team stopped at a four-way fork in the tunnel.


Narrator: You turn to Esaias, who is staring at their map equally perplexed.


>setexpr,Ayin,serious


Esaias(anxious): Based on my maps one of these paths should lead us further into the Ruins...


Illyia(concerned): And let me guess, you don’t know which one.


Esaias(embarrassed): N-No...


Illyia(ashamed): Of course you don’t, why’d I even bother asking?


Dahlia(stressed): Hey, don’t lash out at Saia!


Dahlia(sarcastic): Not like you know which way to go!


Illyia(normal): But I do know how to find out.


Illyia(quietlyhappy): Four doors and four people - you do the math.


Illyia: We fan out and report back here in 30 minutes.


Dahlia(serious): We can’t do that! What if there are more Demons?


Illyia(serious): Then you handle them - we’re all soldiers, aren’t we?


Narrator: Illyia shoots you a nasty look.


Dahlia(concerned): Esaias, what do you think?


Esaias(lookingleft): ...


Esaias(normal): I agree with Illyia.


Esaias(anxious): If I only had a little more data on the paths ahead, I should be able to deduce the correct path forward.


Esaias(normal): 30, no... 15 minutes of scouting down each path should be more than enough to get a sense of the layout.


Illyia(normal): See? Our Navigator seems to agree!


Dahlia(concerned): I’m still against this, we’ve run into so many Demons already.


Ayin: ...


Ayin(nervous): I-I think we should split up too.


Dahlia: !


Dahlia(serious): Are you sure, Ayin? I could go with you-


Illyia(seriously): Ah, our “brave leader” can handle themselves, right?


Ayin(nervoussmile): Y-yeah.


Ayin(normal): Thanks Dahlia, but it’s just a short scouting trip, right?


Ayin(nervous): A-And if something happens, I can always just run back here, right?


Esaias(normal): Actually, for the purposes of data collection, it would be better if you could fight the demons to continue...


Dahlia(perish): ...


Esaias(lookingright): But safety is a priority, so...


Illyia(laughing): Alright, then it’s decided!


Illyia(normal): We’ll meet back here at 13:50 on the dot.


Illyia: Off we go!


>removechar,Illyia


Narrator: Illyia runs off into one of the tunnels.


Dahlia(concerned): Sigh... Ayin, just be careful, OK?


>removechar,Dahlia


Esaias(lookingleft): Best of luck, Ayin.


>removechar,Esaias


Narrator: As each of your party members leave, you start to feel the initial pinpricks of anxiety creep up on you.


Narrator: Taking deep breaths, you head into your own tunnel.[d]


>stopbgm
>playbgm,BGMMenacing


>setexpr,Ayin,nervous


Narrator: You carefully head down the tunnel, noting the direction and shape of the space.


Narrator: Soon after entering, the path curves left and slightly downwards into a small room.


Narrator: The room is dark - only your Typocrypha illuminates the area.


Narrator: There are several paths leading out of the room.


Ayin: (Should I just pick one...?)


Narrator: Suddenly, you start to hear footsteps coming through one of the paths.


>setexpr,Ayin,surprisedbad


Narrator: Without thinking, you run into one of the other pathways to escape.


Narrator: Your heart is pounding, you can’t think straight.


Narrator: You just keep running.


Narrator: ...


Narrator: ...


Narrator: You look around - the area is unfamiliar.


Narrator: How long were you running for?


Narrator: You check your clock - 13:55.


Ayin: (Oh no, I have to get back, where is-)


Narrator: And in your panic, you fail to sense the figure behind you before they’re right next to you.


Narrator: You instinctively fall forward and fumble with your Typocrypha and manage to turn on the dim light on it.


Narrator: The shadowy figure comes into view

>addchar,Niya,0,0,right


Niya: ...! Ayin?


Ayin(surprisedbad): N-Niya?


Narrator: Oh fuck.


>playbgm,BGMMysterious


Niya: ... 


Narrator: Niya puts away their weapon, a strange looking Typocrypha.


Ayin(nervous): ...


Niya: What? Not even going to greet your own family?


Ayin(uncomfortable): Th-that’s not... I...


Ayin: S-Sorry...


Niya(normal): Hmph. 


Niya: ...How’s Ivan?


Ayin(serious): He-Uh, he’s fine.


Ayin: W-What are you doing here anyways, Niya?


>stopbgm


Niya: !?


Niya(bitter): “What are you doing here?”


Niya: This is my home, Ayin, not that fake life you live back on the surface.


Niya: I’m here to defend my home.


Niya: The question is, why are you here?


Niya: You’re here to kill me, right? To kill all demons?


Ayin(surprisedbad): N-no! I don’t... I-I-


Niya: Please, save me the sob story.


Niya(normal): ...


Narrator: Niya pulls their mask over their face.[e]


Niya: Ready your Typocrypha, Ayin.


>playbgm,BGMCurse


//TODO: Fake battle UI comes up, but with no keyboard, with Niya in the center.[f]


Ayin(nervous): Niya, please, we don’t have to do this...


Niya: Yes we do. You chose your side and I chose mine.


Niya: And now that you’re here, there can only be one outcome...


Niya(bitter): Fight me, Ayin!


Ayin(concerned): I... I can’t...


Niya(normal): ...Coward.


Niya: Fine. I’m done holding back.


Narrator: Niya readies a spell, pointed right at you.


Narrator: You close your eyes: You deserve this.


>addchar,Illyia,0,0,left,action,yell


Illyia: SWORD!


//TODO: A magical blast hits Niya.


Narrator: ...Looks like Illyia thinks otherwise.


Niya: Tch... I guess we’ll settle this another time.


//TODO: Niya runs away. Battle UI goes away.

Illyia(serious): Damn demon...


Illyia(concerned): Hey “Leader”, you OK?


Ayin(ohfuck): I-Illyia? I... 


Narrator: Your breathing quickens. It’s happening again.


Ayin: I, I can’t-


Illyia(pissed): Woah, don’t go losing it on me.


Ayin(uncomfortable): I’m sorry, I can’t anymore. I-


Narrator: Illyia lifts you up by the shoulders (quite easily) and starts shaking you.


Illyia: Hey. HEY! Look at me.


Illyia(serious): Breathe!


//todo: add more illyia interaction


Narrator: Illyia stares right at you, but behind her fierce visage, you sense a surprising warmth.


Ayin(serious): (Breathe in... Breathe out...)


Ayin: ...


>playbgm,BGMAgarthanRuins


Ayin(sheepish): S-Sorry, Illyia... I feel a little better now.


Illyia(normal): Good! 


Illyia(serious): Cause we’re not wasting anymore time. Let’s go.


Illyia(ashamed): I don’t want to end up with another team member casualty on my record...


Illyia: Understand?


Ayin(nervous): Uh, yeah...


Illyia(pissed): I SAID, DO YOU UNDERSTAND?


Ayin(surprised): Y-yes ma’am!


Narrator: You instinctively give a tight salute.
