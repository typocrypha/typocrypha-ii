Narrator: Captain’s log - Scouting Team Z\
13:32, 4.5 hours since the start of operation.


>playbgm,BGMBirdPeople


Narrator: We have progressed halfway through the Ruins towards where we believe the First Barrier is.


Narrator: There has been a larger Demon presence than expected, however we have so far had no major casualties.


Narrator: ...


Ayin: {c,ayin}“...”{c}


Ayin(ohfuck): {c,ayin}”(Uhh... What else do I write in these things? Uh...)”{c}


Narrator: Team morale is high.


Dahlia(stressed): {c,dahlia}”Hey, Illyia! That was my ration!”{c}


Illyia(pissed): {c,illyia}”I’m the Forward Guard, you’re just the Medic! I burn more calories than you!”{c}


Narrator: ...Team morale is OK.


Narrator: The team remains focused on our goal to find the First Barrier.


Esaias(normal): {c,esaias}”Ayin, look!”{c}


Ayin(surprisedbad): {c,ayin}”Wh-What is it Esaias? Is it more Demons!?”{c}


Esaias(embarrassed): {c,esaias}”The writing on these tablets are of a quality I have never seen before! If I had to hazard a guess, these were markers used by the Obscurians to help..."{c}


Ayin(concerned): {c,ayin}”...”{c}


Narrator: As Captain, I have faith that our team will be able to find the First Barrier.


Narrator: As long as we stick together-

Illyia(serious): {c,illyia}”Alright team, looks like it’s time for us to split up.”{c}


Ayin(uncomfortable): {c,ayin}”H-Huh?”{c}

Narrator: You look up from your Typocrypha to see the team stopped at a four-way fork in the tunnel.


Narrator: Esaias is staring at his map equally perplexed.


>setexpr,Ayin,serious


Esaias(anxious): Based on my maps one of these paths should lead us further into the Ruins...


Illyia(concerned): And let me guess, you don’t know which one.


Esaias(embarrassed): N-No...


Illyia(ashamed): Of course you don’t, why’d I even bother asking?


Dahlia(stressed): Hey, don’t lash out at Saia!


Dahlia(sarcastic): Not like you know which way to go!


Illyia(normal): But I do know how to find out.


Illyia(quietlyhappy): Four doors and four people - you do the math.


Illyia: We fan out and report back here in 30 minutes.


Dahlia(serious): We can’t do that! What if there are more Demons?


Illyia(serious): Then you handle them - we’re all soldiers, aren’t we?


Narrator: Illyia shoots you a nasty look.


Dahlia(concerned): Esaias, what do you think?


Esaias(lookingleft): ...


Esaias(normal): I agree with Illyia.


Esaias(anxious): If I only had a little more data on the paths ahead, I should be able to deduce the correct path forward.


Esaias(normal): 30, no... 15 minutes of scouting down each path should be more than enough to get a sense of the layout.


Illyia(normal): See? Our Navigator seems to agree!


Dahlia(concerned): I’m still against this, we’ve run into so many Demons already.


Ayin: ...


Ayin(nervous): I-I think we should split up too.


Dahlia(serious): Are you sure, Ayin? I could go with you-


Illyia(serious): Ah, our “brave leader” can handle themselves, right?


Ayin(nervoussmile): Um, y-yeah.


Ayin(normal): Thanks Dahlia, but it’s just a short scouting trip, right?


Ayin(nervous): A-And if something happens, I can always just run back here...


Esaias(normal): Actually, for the purposes of data collection, it would be better if you could fight the demons to continue...


Dahlia(perish): ...


Esaias(lookingright): But safety is a priority, so...


Illyia(laughing): Alright, then it’s decided!


Illyia(normal): We’ll meet back here at 13:50 on the dot.


Illyia: Off we go!


>removechar,Illyia


Narrator: Illyia runs off into one of the tunnels.


Dahlia(concerned): Sigh... Ayin, just be careful, OK?


>removechar,Dahlia


Esaias(lookingleft): Best of luck, Ayin.

>stopbgm


Narrator: As each of your party members leave, you start to feel the initial pinpricks of anxiety creep up on you.


Narrator: Taking deep breaths, you head into your own tunnel.


>playbgm,BGMRuinsUnease


>setexpr,Ayin,nervous


Narrator: You carefully head down the tunnel, noting the direction and shape of the space.


Narrator: Soon after entering, the path curves left into a small room.


Narrator: The room is dark - only your Typocrypha illuminates the area.


Narrator: There are several paths leading out of the room.


Ayin: (Should I just pick one...?)


Narrator: Suddenly, you start to hear footsteps coming through one of the paths.


>setexpr,Ayin,surprisedbad


Narrator: Without thinking, you run into one of the other pathways to escape.


Narrator: Your heart is pounding, you can’t think straight.


Narrator: You just keep running.


Narrator: ...


Narrator: ...


Narrator: You look around - the area is unfamiliar.


Narrator: How long were you running for?


Narrator: You check your clock - 13:55.


Ayin: (I have to get back, where is-)


>stopbgm


Narrator: *rustle[a]*


Narrator: ...someone is in the room with you.


Narrator: You instinctively fall forward and fumble with your Typocrypha and manage to turn on its dim light.


Narrator: The shadowy figure comes into view


//TODO: Dialog UI dimly fades back in


>addchar,Niya,0,0,right


Niya: ...! Ayin?[b]


Ayin(surprisedbad): N-Niya?


>playbgm,BGMMysterious


Narrator: Standing before you is Niya, your twin.


Narrator: By appearance your spitting image, but truth be told they couldn’t be any more different from you.


Narrator: They glare at you menacingly.


Niya: ... 


Ayin(nervous): ...


Niya: What? No hello?


Ayin(uncomfortable): Th-that’s not... I...


Ayin: S-Sorry...


Niya(normal): Hmph. 


Niya: ...How’s Ivan?


Ayin(serious): He-Uh, he’s fine.


Ayin(serious): ...


Ayin(ohfuck): H-How’re you, Niya?


Niya: ...


Narrator: Niya squints at you, and lets out a sigh.


Niya: I’m fine.


Niya: Anyways, are we going to do this?


Ayin(surprisedbad): W-What?


>stopbgm


Narrator: Niya pulls down their mask over their [c]face...


Narrator: ...and takes out their weapon, a strange-looking Typocrypha, aiming it directly at you.
