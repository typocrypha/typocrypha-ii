Ayin[0,1]: Ow!


Esaias[0,2]: Ayin! Please exercise more caution when attacking these demons.


Esaias[0,2](lookingright): Their spikes can cause you great harm if attacked recklessly.


Esaias[0,2](whut): Was this information not located on your scanner?


Ayin[0,1]: Uh, scan...?


Esaias[0,2](embarrassed): ... Ah, I see. My apologies.

Esaias[0,2]: Pufferfish demons have spikes which reflect most attacks.
