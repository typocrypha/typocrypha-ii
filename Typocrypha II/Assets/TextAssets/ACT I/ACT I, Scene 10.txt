Dahlia: What happened to “minimal demon resistance”, Saia?


Esaias: I- this must be a result of the frontal assault... Or perhaps a collapse in the tunnels-


Illyia(normal): Alright, finally some action! Engaging!


Dahlia: Illyia, wait!


>removechar,Illyia


Narrator: Illyia charges off into the demon horde.


Dahlia(stressed): Argh!


Dahlia(serious): I’m going to go cover Illyia. Saia, stick with Ayin, OK?


Esaias(normal): Understood.


>removechar,Dahlia


Esaias: Ayin, are you prepared to engage?


Ayin(serious): H-huh?! Uh, yeah! I-I’m ready!

Ayin(concerned[a]): Ow!


Esaias: Ayin! Please exercise more caution when attacking these demons.


Esaias(lookingright): Their spikes can cause you great harm if attacked recklessly.


Esaias(whut): Was this information not located on your scanner?


Ayin(uncomfortable): Uh, scan...?


Esaias(embarrassed): ... Ah, I see. My apologies.


Esaias(lookingleft): On your Typocrypha, hold SHIFT to scan for additional information on demons.

Ayin(concerned[b]): W-woah!


Esaias: Good work, Ayin.


Esaias: Pufferfish demons have spikes which reflect most attacks.


Esaias: However, due to their inflated nature, piercing spells like LANCE do extra damage and cause them to burst when defeated.


Ayin(nervous): Oh, uh, c-can you say that one more time?


Esaias: Do not worry, you can review this information by holding SHIFT on your Typocrypha while targeting the enemy to scan it.
