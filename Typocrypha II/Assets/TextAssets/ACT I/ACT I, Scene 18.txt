Illyia: ...OK, this is actually a lot of demons.


Ayin: Esaias! H-How long until the assault teams arrive?


Esaias: They are not far now. Approximately 60 seconds until arrival.


Esaias (lookingleft): I have put out a distress beacon, so they should be on their way...


Dahlia: Everyone stay close! We can do this!

Dahlia[2,1]: Don’t thank me just yet: SUTURE has a ridiculously long cooldown.
