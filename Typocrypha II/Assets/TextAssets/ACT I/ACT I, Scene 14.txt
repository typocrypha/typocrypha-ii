Dahlia: N-No, it’s not just them. There are two other strong demons...


Narrator: You feel the air temperature suddenly increase from behind.


Narrator: Just as you turn around, you’re forced to shield your eyes from a blinding, fiery glow.

Bunbuku: Hmph! Arrogant humans!


Bunbuku: You think you’re hot stuff don’t ya? Beating on my disciples!


Bunbuku: But we’re not done yet, right boys?


Narrator: Suddenly, as if inheriting this demon’s fiery spirit, the other demons become reinvigorated.

[a]Should probably add a timed event for if the player goes a long time just fighting tanukis without actually decoding (like a reminder)
[b]game doesnt proceed until they do this.
[c]horde wave goes on forever until decoding tutorial (basically the whole wave) is complete
[d]from here, there are only a few tanuki left (no more horde spawns)
