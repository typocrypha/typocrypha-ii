Ayin(nervous): M-More demons?


Illyia: Alright, I hope you’re done moping around “Leader!”


Illyia(normal): You know how to use your scanner, right?


Ayin(cheerful): Y-yes! I just have to hold SHIFT.


Illyia: Good! You’ll need it.


Illyia(serious): These demons look like they have tough defenses.

Illyia[0,2](pissed): What do you think you’re doing?


Illyia[0,2]: You won’t do any damage like that!


Ayin[0,1]: I, Uh, what else am I supposed to do?


Illyia[0,2](concerned): ... 


Illyia[0,2]: Ya know, I’ve been meaning to ask.


Illyia[0,2](serious): Why have you been just casting one spell at a time?


Ayin[0,1](concerned): ...


Ayin[0,1](ohfuck): I-Is that bad? 


Illyia[0,2](concerned): ...


Illyia[0,2](ashamed): I can’t believe you’re the leader instead of me...


Illyia[0,2](serious): Just- Just try typing in multiple words before casting.

Illyia[0,2](laughing): There ya go! Hey, maybe you’re not so bad after all!


Illyia[0,2](normal): Using multiple words in a spell at once increases the effect of the spell words.


Ayin[0,1](surprised): Wow!


Ayin[0,1](squint): Are there any downsides?


Illyia[0,2](laughing): No, not really! It’s basically free damage!


Illyia[0,2](concerned): ...


Illyia[0,2](ashamed): Weeell, your spells do still go on cooldown.


Illyia[0,2]: ... and if you use the same spell word multiple times it goes on longer cooldown.


Illyia[0,2](laughing): But, I never really have that issue, so you should be fine!


Ayin[0,1]: ...


Narrator[1,0]: When you multicast, the extra cooldown time can be seen in {c,highlight}orange{c}.


Narrator[1,0]: Make sure to multicast responsibly!

Ayin: Phew...


Illyia: You take care of the ones over there, “Leader?”


Ayin(nervoussmile): Y-yeah, somehow.


Ayin(normal): How about you-


Narrator: You see a large pile of incapacitated demon souls behind Illyia.


Illyia(ashamed): There weren’t too many who came my way, to be honest.


Ayin(ohfuck): I-I see...


Narrator: You’re very glad Illyia is on your side.


Illyia(serious): But enough chatting. Here come some more!

Ayin(normal): OK, I think I’m getting the hang of it.


Illyia(quietlyhappy): Hey, maybe you’re worth more than a distraction after all.


Ayin(sheepish): Th-Thanks?


Illyia(serious): Little tip: these next demons are tough.


Illyia: You do not want to get caught in their spells.


Illyia(normal): So just remember: Go for the beard!


Ayin(ohfuck): The... The what?
