Ayin(nervous): M-More demons?


Illyia: No more time for moping around, “Leader!”


Illyia: You know how to use your scanner, right?


Ayin(cheerful): Y-yes! I just have to press SHIFT...


Illyia: Good - These demons look like they have tough defenses.

Illyia[0,2](pissed): What do you think you’re doing?


Illyia[0,2]: You won’t do any damage like that!


Ayin[0,1]: I, uh, what else am I supposed to do!?


Illyia[0,2](serious): Alright “leader”, {c,ui-terms}Multicasting{c} 101.


Illyia[0,2](normal): Type in multiple words before you cast! The more the better!


Illyia[0,2](normal): Like “SWORD SWORD SWORD”, or something!


Ayin[0,1]: ...That’s it?


Illyia[0,2](serious): That’s it!


Illyia[0,2]: These Adderstone demons are particularly weak to multicast spells with 3 words.

Illyia[0,2](ashamed): Well, I guess you’re not totally hopeless...


Ayin[0,1]: Th-Thanks?


Illyia[0,2](serious): Just remember: while your spells {c,ui-terms}do more damage in combos...{c}


Illyia[0,2]: ...if you use the same spell word multiple times, it goes on an {c,highlight}extended cooldown{c}.

Ayin: Phew...


Illyia: You take care of the ones over there, “Leader?”


Ayin(nervoussmile): Y-yeah, somehow.


Ayin(normal): How about you-


Narrator: You see a large pile of incapacitated demon souls behind Illyia.


Illyia(ashamed): There weren’t too many who came my way, to be honest.


Ayin(ohfuck): I-I see...


Narrator: You’re very glad Illyia is on your side.


Illyia(serious): But enough chatting. Here come some more!

Illyia(serious): Little tip: these next demons are tough.


Illyia: You do not want to get caught in their spells.
