Ayin(nervous): M-More demons?


Illyia: Alright, I hope you’re done moping around “Leader!”


Illyia(normal): You know how to use your scanner, right?


Ayin(cheerful): Y-yes! I just have to hold SHIFT.


Illyia: Good! You’ll need it.


Illyia(serious): These demons look like they have tough defenses.

Illyia[0,2](pissed): What do you think you’re doing?


Illyia[0,2]: You won’t do any damage like that!


Ayin[0,1]: I, uh, what else am I supposed to do!?


Illyia[0,2](serious): Alright “leader”, {c,ui-terms}Multicasting{c} 101.


Illyia[0,2](normal): Type in multiple words before you cast!


Illyia[0,2](normal): Like “SWORD HAMMER”, or something!


Ayin[0,1]: ... That’s it?


Illyia[0,2](serious): That’s it!


Illyia[0,2]: These Adderstone demons are particularly weak to multicast spells.

Illyia[0,2](laughing): See, now you got it!


Illyia[0,2](normal): Using multiple words in a spell at once increases the effect of the spell words.


Ayin[0,1](surprised): Wow!


Ayin[0,1](squint): Are there any downsides?


Illyia[0,2](laughing): No, not really! It’s basically free damage!


Illyia[0,2](concerned): ...


Illyia[0,2](ashamed): Weeell, your spells do still go on cooldown.


Illyia[0,2]: ... and if you use the same spell word multiple times it goes on longer cooldown.


Illyia[0,2](laughing): But, I never really run into issues with that, so you should be fine!


Ayin[0,1]: ...


Narrator[0,0]: When you Multicast, the extra cooldown time can be seen in {c,highlight}orange{c}.


Narrator[0,0]: Make sure to Multicast responsibly, or you might run out of spells to use![a]

Ayin: Phew...


Illyia: You take care of the ones over there, “Leader?”


Ayin(nervoussmile): Y-yeah, somehow.


Ayin(normal): How about you-


Narrator: You see a large pile of incapacitated demon souls behind Illyia.[b]


Illyia(ashamed): There weren’t too many who came my way, to be honest.


Ayin(ohfuck): I-I see...


Narrator: You’re very glad Illyia is on your side.


Illyia(serious): But enough chatting. Here come some more!

Ayin(normal): OK, I think I’m getting the hang of it.


Illyia(quietlyhappy): Hey, maybe you’re worth more than a distraction after all.


Ayin(sheepish): Th-Thanks?


Illyia(serious): Little tip: these next demons are tough.


Illyia: You do not want to get caught in their spells.


Illyia(normal): So just remember: Go for the beard!


Ayin(ohfuck): The... The what?

[a]May want to reword to "or your Typocrypha might {c,ui-terms}overheat{c}!" to introduce the terminology and to make the player not worry that they are going to softlock or anything
[b]May not make sense with how the demon wisps normally run away
