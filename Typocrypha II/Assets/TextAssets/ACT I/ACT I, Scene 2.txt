Narrator: You’re waiting for Adelai at the Typocrypho restaurant.


Narrator: She’s late.


Ayin(nervous): ...


Ayin: Maybe I should call her...


Narrator: You see Adelai run in through the door.

Adelai(frustrated): Oh my god Ayin I’m so sorry!


Adelai(frustrateddistant): I left right after I texted you but then the train was late and I forgot my keys and-


Ayin(nervoussmile): Uh, i-it’s OK Adelai[a][b]. I saw your texts. 


Narrator: You didn’t get a chance to read them all, since there were over 60 of them.


Narrator: Adelai is a really fast typer.


Adelai: Sorry-[pause,0.2]^shake^Urgh|shake|! It’s just frustrating.


Adelai(bffs4ever): Anyways, did you already order?


Ayin(normal): Yeah, two orders of boat noodles[c].


Adelai(serious): And you got the sizes right? So a-


Ayin(normal): -Small for me and large for you.


Adelai(normal): Perfect, thank you so much.


Adelai(caring): You should treat yourself to a large sometimes!


Ayin(nervoussmile): Well, money’s been kind of tight recently so...


Adelai(interested): Ah, right...


Adelai: But your dad[d]’s been helping you with the school fees, right?


Ayin(normal): Ivan? Well as much as he can.


Ayin(sheepish): But I don’t want to burden him too much. 


Ayin: He’s been working a lot of overtime, as usual.


Ayin(concerned): Some days I don’t even see him come home...


Adelai: Why doesn’t he come back to work for Ostanes?


Adelai(teasing): I’m sure we could pay him better, at least. 


Ayin(normal): I’ve brought it up before, but he always tries to dodge the subject.


Adelai(normal): Well, if he ever changes his mind let me know, I could probably put a good word in with my dad[e].


//For now until TIPS is implemented
Narrator: You have mixed feelings about exploiting the fact that Adelai’s dad is the CEO of Ostanes.


Adelai(frustrateddistant): Sigh... Not that I really see him that much, either.


Adelai: He’s been in constant meetings with the board and AEIOU[f]. 


Adelai: Feels like they’re planning something...


Ayin: Like what?


Adelai(normal): Hm? Oh, I don’t know. 


Adelai: I try to keep my nose out of all that bureaucracy.


Adelai: Although I have been seeing a lot more of aunty-[pause,0.1]err,[pause,0.1] General Agnes[g].


Adelai(serious): Maybe they’re planning on finally going into the Ruins[h] and just destroying all those stupid demons...


Narrator: Adelai seems lost in thought. 


Narrator: She’s been feeling distant like this a lot recently.


Ayin(sheepish): S-so, sounds like both our dads are pretty busy, huh? 


Adelai(bffs4ever): ...Hehe, yeah. 


Adelai(teasing): Hey, do you remember that old play room at the Ostanes office?


Ayin(sheepish): Mmm, what was that again?


Adelai(normal): C’mon, remember? 


Adelai: We were always playing with each other there while our dads were working.


Narrator: Back then... You try not to think about stuff from back then.


Narrator: Back before Niya...


Adelai(teasing): And speaking of waiting around, our food’s taking a while, huh?


Adelai(normal): Maybe I’ll go ask-

Narrator: [screen-shake,2,0.5] A large explosion shakes the restaurant and throws you to the ground.


Narrator: Once the shaking stops, your Typocrypha starts playing an alarm message.


>addchar,Clarke,0,0.2


Clarke: ATTENTION. ATTENTION. 


Clarke: Demons have attacked 3rd st. Ostanes Warehouse in Financial District C.


Clarke: Please evacuate the area immediately.


Clarke: The Exterminators[i] are on their way to address the situation.


Clarke: Repeat, please evacuate immediately.


Clarke: ATTENTION...


Narrator: The alarm continues on a shrill loop.


>removechar,Clarke


Adelai(serious): Ayin? Are you OK?


Ayin(nervous): I-I... 


Narrator: A cold wave of anxiety washes over you. 


Narrator: Your arms start to feel numb and tingly.


Ayin(ohfuck): H-Haa.... I’m s-sorry, I c-c-can’t...


Adelai: Hey, Ayin, look at me! 


Adelai(caring): Breathe.[pause,0.2] Breathe, Ayin.


Ayin(uncomfortable): Haaa... Haa...


Narrator: Adelai takes your hand into hers and you focus just on that warmth.


Narrator: A moment passes. 


Adelai: Have you calmed down a bit?


Ayin: Y-yeah... Sorry, Adelai.


Ayin(sheepish): I’m always h-holding you back, aren’t I?


Adelai: Of course you’re not. We’re friends, right?


Narrator: You nod wordlessly, and Adelai smiles back.


Adelai: C’mon, that explosion sounded really close to here. We better evacuate.
