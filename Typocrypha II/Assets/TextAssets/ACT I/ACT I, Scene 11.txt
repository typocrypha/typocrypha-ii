Narrator: You pause for a moment, the adrenaline still pumping through your veins.


Narrator: The Ruins are quiet. It’s only you and Esaias.


Ayin(concerned): Phew... We’re OK now, right?


Esaias(anxious): Yes, there do not seem to be any more demon responses.


Esaias(normal): We should regroup with Dahlia and Illyia.


Ayin(normal): Yeah, let’s go.


Ayin(nervous): Where did all those demons come from, anyways?


Esaias(whut): I suspect that tremor we felt was a result of the main attack teams.


Esaias(lookingleft): Perhaps a part of the Ruins collapsed, funneling the demons towards us. 


Esaias(lookingright): I’m going to have to rethink our route...


//TODO: Ground starts shaking.


Ayin(surprisedbad): W-what’s happening!?


Esaias(anxious): Look out!!


Narrator: You look up, and see a large part of the ceiling begin to crumble.


Narrator: You stumble backwards right as it falls in front of you.


//TODO: Wall collapses. Screen fades to black. Floating text on black.


>removechar,Esaias


Ayin(nervous): E-Esaias? Hello?


Ayin: Is anyone there?


Narrator: You fumble with your Typocrypha and manage to turn on the dim light on it.


Narrator: In the distance, you see a shadowy figure approach.


//TODO: Dialog UI dimly fades back in


>addchar,Niya,0,0,right


Niya: ...! Ayin[a]?


Ayin(surprisedbad): N-Niya?


Narrator: Oh fuck.


Niya: Long time no see, traitor.


Ayin(nervous): ...


Niya: What? Not even going to greet your own family?


Ayin(uncomfortable): Th-that’s not... I...


Ayin: S-Sorry...


Niya: Hmph. 


Niya: ... How’s Ivan?


Ayin(serious): He-Uh, he’s fine.


Ayin: W-What are you doing here anyways, Niya?


Niya: !?


Niya: “What are you doing here?”


Niya: This is my true home, Ayin, not that fake life you live back on the surface.


Niya: I’m here to defend my home.


Niya: The question is, why are you here?


Niya: You’re here to kill me, right? To kill all demons?


Ayin(surprisedbad): N-no! I don’t... I-I-


Niya: Please, save me the sob story.


Niya: ...


Narrator: Niya pulls their mask over their face.


Niya: Pick up your Typocrypha, Ayin.


//TODO: Fake battle UI comes up, but with no keyboard, with Niya in the center.


Ayin(nervous): Niya, please, we don’t have to do this...


Niya: Yes we do. You chose your side and I chose mine.


Niya: And now that you’re here, there can only be one outcome...


Niya: Fight me, Ayin!


Ayin(concerned): I... I can’t...


Niya: ... Coward.


Niya: Fine. I’m done holding back.


Narrator: Niya readies a spell, pointed right at you.


Narrator: You close your eyes: You deserve this.


>addchar,Illyia,0,0,left,action,yell


Illyia: SWORD!


//TODO: A magical blast hits Niya.


Narrator: ...Looks like Illyia thinks otherwise.


Niya: Tch... I guess we’ll settle this another time.


//TODO: Niya runs away. Battle UI goes away.


>removechar,Niya


>removechar,Illyia


>addchar,Illyia,0,0,right,base,serious


Illyia(serious): Damn demon...


Illyia(concerned): Hey “Leader”, you OK?


Ayin(ohfuck): I-Illyia? I... 


Narrator: Your breathing quickens. It’s happening again.


Ayin: I, I can’t-


Illyia(pissed): Woah, don’t go losing it on me.


Ayin(uncomfortable): I’m sorry, I can’t anymore. I-


Narrator: Illyia lifts you up by the shoulders (quite easily) and starts shaking you.


Illyia: Hey. HEY! Look at me.


Illyia(serious): Breathe!


Narrator: Illyia stares right at you, but behind her fierce visage, you sense a surprising warmth[b].


Ayin(serious): (Breathe in... Breathe out...)


Ayin: ...


Ayin(sheepish): S-Sorry, Illyia... I feel a little better now.


Illyia(normal): Good! 


Illyia(serious): Cause we’re not wasting anymore time. Let’s go.


Illyia(ashamed): I don’t want to end up with another team member casualty on my record...


Illyia: Understand?


Ayin(nervous): Uh, yeah...


Illyia(pissed): I SAID, DO YOU UNDERSTAND?


Ayin(surprised): Y-yes ma’am!


Narrator: You instinctively give a tight salute.


>addchar,Clarke,0,0,left


Clarke: WARNING! WARNING!


Ayin(surprisedbad): ...!


Illyia(laughing): Alright! Here comes the perfect wake-up call!
