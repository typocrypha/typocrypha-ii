Narrator: Lying in bed, you take a quick glance over at your Typocrypha.


Narrator: 99+ unread messages from Adelai...


Ayin(squint): ...


Ayin(uncomfortable): ...


Narrator: You turn away from the notification screen to get some water.

???:[a] \*KNOCK\* \*KNOCK\* \*KNOCK\* This is AEIOU! Ayin A. you are to report for duty!


Ayin(ohfuck): !!


Narrator: Having ignored most communications, you were hoping AEIOU would overlook a random student like yourself.


Narrator: Maybe if you just stay quiet they’ll give up eventually...


???: \*KNOCK\* \*KNOCK\* We know you’re in there! And we’re not giving up until you come out!


Ayin(nervous): C-Coming!


Narrator: You open the door, mentally preparing yourself for a scolding.

Narrator: ... But you weren’t expecting a hug.

Adelai: Ayin!


Ayin: A-Adelai? Why are you...


Adelai(caring): Well, you didn’t answer any of my messages... 


Adelai(teasing):[b] Bet you couldn’t tell it was me, right?


Ayin(sheepish): Uh, y-yeah...


Ayin(uncomfortable): ...


Narrator: As the freshness of the unexpected meeting begins to dissipate, Adelai changes her tone as well.


>stopbgm


Adelai(serious): Ayin... You know you can’t keep running away from this, right?


Ayin: I...


Adelai(interested): ...


Adelai: Here.


Narrator: Adelai hands you a manila folder - you feel a small metallic object inside.


Adelai: Your mission briefing and locator beacon.


Ayin(surprisedbad): !!


Ayin(uncomfortable): S-So you’re here to force me into the draft after all...


Adelai(serious): It’s either that or get sent to prison for deserting, Ayin!


Adelai(normal): ...and besides, I think once you take a look, you might feel a little better.


>setexpr,Ayin,serious


Narrator: Reluctantly, you open the folder, and begin paging through the briefing.


>playbgm,BGMMysterious


Narrator: “Operation Raindance”


Narrator: Goal - Destroy the First Barrier, one of three barriers blocking passage to the Evil Eye.


Narrator: 26 small scouting teams will be sent into the first layer of the Ruins to locate the First Barrier, whose exact location is currently unknown.


Narrator: Once a scouting team locates the first barrier, they are to plant a locator beacon to signal the main attack team to strike.


Narrator: Assignment for Ayin A. - Captain of Scouting Team Z.


Ayin(surprised): Captain! Me?


Adelai(bffs4ever): Pretty cool, right?


Ayin(uncomfortable): N-no! How did I even end up captain...


Adelai(teasing): Well you did take out a bunch of demons during the Seven Stars attack, remember?


Ayin(nervous): That was mostly you...


Adelai(normal): Anyways! Look, you’re just in the scouting team!


Ayin(squint): And why is that a good thing?


Ayin: Won’t I be sent deep into the Ruins?


Adelai(teasing): And if you run into a bunch of demons, you can just run away!


Adelai(interested): Err, well maybe not just run away, but there would probably be another path right?


Adelai(ifonly): A-and, you have 25 other teams also looking, so...


>stopbgm


Ayin: ...


Adelai: ...


Adelai(frustrated): OK Ayin, yeah, it’ll be dangerous.


>playbgm,BGMSecondHand


Adelai(frustrateddistant): I can’t promise it’ll be easy.


Narrator: Silently, Adelai reaches out and takes the locator beacon, placing it firmly in your hand.


Adelai(serious): Which is why, Ayin, you have to be the one to find the First Barrier.


Ayin(uncomfortable): But, before you were saying-


Adelai: Because! Once you do and you activate that beacon.


Adelai: I promise you, I will be there to protect you.


>setexpr,Ayin,serious


Adelai (interested): I was assigned to the main attack teams - the ones who will come in and destroy the First Barrier once we find it.


Adelai(frustrateddistant): I wanted to be on the scouting team with you, but my request was... denied.


Adelai: This is the only way I can protect you...




Ayin(nervous): But I-I don’t know if I can do it...


Adelai(serious): You can do it, Ayin!


Adelai(caring): I know I can trust you to make it to the First Barrier.


Adelai: So please, can you trust me?


Narrator: You flash back to all of your time with Adelai.


Narrator: All of the times Adelai’s saved you, supported you.


Narrator: And in all those times, this might be the first time Adelai has asked something of you.


Narrator: The locator beacon in your hand - no larger than a fountain pen - weighs heavy in your hand.


Narrator: You tighten your grip.


Ayin(nervoussmile): I-I guess I can try...
