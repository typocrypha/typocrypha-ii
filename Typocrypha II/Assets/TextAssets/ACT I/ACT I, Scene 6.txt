Narrator: DATE: 3/13 


Narrator: LOCATION: Residential Block A


Narrator: DEMON ACTIVITY: Medium


Adelai(caring): We... We made it...


Adelai(frustrated): -Ow!


Ayin(nervous): Adelai?!


Adelai(caring): I-It’s nothing. I just got a bruise on my leg.


Adelai(normal): It’ll heal up on it’s own. 


Ayin(concerned): L-let me see, maybe Ivan put some bandages somewhere around here...


Adelai: You’re not hurt anywhere?


Ayin: No, at least I-I don’t think so...


Adelai(bffs4ever): Thank god, if something were to happen to you...


Adelai(frustrateddistant): ... Damn demons. Isn’t it enough that they forced us into lockdown?


Adelai: If only I was stronger, I’d-

Clarke: Notice to all Agarthan citizens: please standby for official announcement from AEIOU on demon attack at Seven Stars Station.

Kaia: Citizens of Agartha. I am General Kaia Agnes, head of the Administrative branch of AEIOU.


Kaia: It has been 15 long years since the Demons of Obscurai broke the peace by attacking and slaughtering our people.


Kaia: And, during this time, you have all stayed strong.


Kaia: You have stayed diligent, looking out for each other.


Kaia: You have persevered in hopes that life would one day return to normal.


Kaia: Today, that hope for normalcy has been viciously challenged by the demons and their Evil Eye.


Kaia: Earlier this evening, Demons attacked the Seven Stars station in Shopping District B. Several casualties have been reported, and as our teams are still addressing the situation, we expect those numbers to rise.


Kaia: I fought alongside our brave first responders from AEIOU, and personally stood witness to an entirely new breed of chaos.


Kaia: And, while I am happy to say that we met this challenge with the very best of Agartha, this surely will not be the last of such tragedies.


Kaia: We, the true people of Agartha, know what must be done.


Kaia: It is time to be rid of the demons from our city once and for all.


/*Short pause: Screen goes a little staticy with Evil Eye motifs.*/


Kaia: No more lockdown, no more hiding in our homes, no more futile attempts at peace. 


Kaia: I announce here and now the start of the Agarthan Sanitization Project. 


Kaia: The project, which will be spearheaded by AEIOU, is a clear and comprehensive plan to finally defeat the demon menace and clean out the Ruins of their evil presence. 


Kaia: Having the Agarthan Sanitization Project succeed will require a significant amount of resources, of course. 


Kaia: But by far, the most important thing we will need to succeed is all of you.


Kaia: For the bravest among you, for those who have something to fight for, I ask of you to help Agartha break free from the gaze of the Evil Eye.


Kaia: I leave you all with a prayer for those who have lost their lives fighting against the demons: may their souls rise high above on the Wings of Agartha...


Kaia: ...


Kaia: Thank you for your time.

Ayin(embarrassed): Huh... I guess that’s the thing AEIOU was planning, huh?


Narrator: Adelai doesn’t respond, seeming deep in thought.


Ayin(concerned): Are you sure you’re OK, Adelai?


Adelai(normal): ... Yeah, sorry. I was just... thinking.


Adelai(ifonly): I mean, this is it, right? This is a chance to finally go into the Ruins and destroy the Evil Eye!


Adelai: Finally, we’ll be free from the demons and the lockdown.


Adelai(serious): ... I’m going to volunteer.


Ayin(nervous): B-but, won’t it be dangerous? I mean, just look at what happened today...


Adelai: We were caught off-guard today, but once we have the full force of AEIOU? 


Adelai(normal): The demons won’t stand a chance.


Adelai(serious): ... You still have my back on this, right?


Ayin(uncomfortable): ... I, I don’t know... I mean-


Adelai(normal): No, I’m sorry Ayin. I know it’s been a long day.


Adelai: We should both go home and rest, yeah?


Ayin(nervoussmile): Y-yeah...


Adelai(bffs4ever): OK, I’ll see you later.
