Dahlia: Ayin!


Narrator: Dahlia joins your side, with Esaias over her shoulder.


Ayin(surprised): Dahlia! Esaias! Are you two OK?


Esaias: No, but...


Esaias(normal): We’re here to help.


Dahlia: SUTURE!

Ayin: Did... Did we do it?


Dahlia: I think so...?


Narrator: For a moment, everything is still. You start to relax your shoulders.


Narrator: But then, you take a look at the spirit orb left behind by the demon...


Narrator: ...And a phrase suddenly pops into your head. 


Narrator: “The Eye of the Storm”


//TODO: >screen-shake[a] 




Narrator: A raging hurricane forms around the party, ripping off stones from the Ruins walls and sending them crashing into each other.


Illyia(pissed): W-What the hell is happening? Esaias!


Esaias(lookingright): I... don’t know. 


Esaias(anxious): We reduced the demon to its spirit form but its magic levels keep increasing.


Dahlia(concerned): At this rate, the storm will cause a tunnel collapse and trap everyone inside...


Ayin(nervous): We need to stop it... But how?


Narrator: Your mind begins to race, your breathing quickens.


Narrator: You can’t calm yourself down, but perhaps thanks to that, you come up with an idea.


Ayin(serious): Clarke!


>addchar,Clarke,0,0,right


Clarke: Yes?


Ayin: Can you run the DECODE protocol on Mari[b]?


Clarke: Calculating... Calculating...


Clarke: ERROR: Not enough memory. 


Clarke: Attempting to run sequential batch processes...


Clarke: Time remaining to complete process: Approx 33 seconds.


Ayin: Everyone... I have a plan, but it’ll take some time.


Ayin: Can you help me cover me?


Dahlia(happy): You got it, Ayin!


Esaias(normal): Yes, we can do that.


Illyia(normal): Alright, let’s get to work!
