Illyia(serious): Looks like that’s the last of them.


Ayin(nervous): Y-yeah...


Ayin: ...


Illyia(concerned): C’mon, no time for sitting around.


Ayin: Right, um...


Illyia: What?


Ayin(sheepish): Thanks, Illyia. For, uh, helping me out there.


Illyia(ashamed): ... Hmph. Yeah, whatever.


Illyia: Let’s go. We should be able to get around the cave-in if we go this way.

>playbgm,BGMMysterious


Narrator: You and Illyia start moving through the Ruins.




Illyia(concerned): Hey, “Leader”.


Illyia: What was up with that demon you were fighting when I found you, anyways?


Ayin(ohfuck): Uh, wh-what do you m-mean?


Illyia(serious): Thought I heard talking when I approached


Ayin: I-I, y-you know, it was just like, uh...


Illyia(concerned): ...


Illyia: You know that there’s no reasoning with them, right?


Illyia(serious): ... With the demons.


Ayin(serious): ...


Narrator: You’ve always avoided these conversations.


Narrator: You’ve always just brushed them off.


Narrator: But right now is different for some reason.


Narrator: Maybe it’s because you’re in the Ruins.


Narrator: ... Or maybe it was your encounter with Niya.


Narrator: But you decide to take a step forward.


Ayin(nervous): D-Do you not like demons, Illyia? 


>stopbgm


Narrator: Illyia suddenly stops and turns to face you.


Illyia(pissed): You...!


Illyia(ashamed): I...


Illyia(concerned): ...


Narrator: Illyia’s face continues to contort in confusion, flashing back and forth between rage and contemplation.

>setexpr,Illyia,quietlyhappy


Narrator: ... And, somehow, ends in a soft smile.


Ayin(ohfuck): Uh...


Illyia(normal): You really don’t know anything about me, huh?


Ayin(surprisedbad): I-I’m sorry, I just-


Illyia(laughing): Haha, I’m just messin’ with ya.


Illyia(quietlyhappy): You might be the first person I’ve met who didn’t see the “Xiong” in my name before everything else.


>setexpr,Ayin,serious


Illyia: ...


Narrator: Illyia turns around and continues walking down the corridor.


Narrator: And then, as if talking to no one in particular, she begins speaking again.


Illyia: My mom, Irene[a] Xiong, was the matriarch of the Xiong family.


Illyia: We came to Agartha on a security contract with Ostanes.


Illyia: My mom...


Illyia(concerned): ... She died in the first demon invasion[b]. 


Illyia: It was...


Illyia(ashamed): -Well, it was so long ago, I don’t remember it so well now.


Narrator: You remember - in fact you wish you could forget all about it.


Narrator: The first demon attack XX[c] years ago, before Seven Stars.


Narrator: The one that put Agartha into lockdown, and the one that...


Ayin(uncomfortable): ... 


Illyia(ashamed): A-Anyways, now you know.


Illyia: ... Hope that answers your question.


Ayin(nervous): I-


Ayin: ...


Ayin(serious): Th-Thank you, Illyia, for, um, telling me.


Illyia(concerned): ...


Narrator: Illyia doesn’t respond and keeps walking.


Narrator: The two of you continue in silence through the Ruins.


>stopbgm


Narrator: Eventually, you spot a familiar green jacket in the distance


>playbgm,BGMExplorer


>addchar,Esaias,0,0,right


Esaias(normal[d]): Ayin! Illyia!


Ayin(happy): Esaias! I’m glad you’re OK.


Esaias: The feeling is mutual.


Esaias(lookingleft): I see you also found Illyia.


Narrator: Without missing a beat, Illyia jumps in-


Illyia(ashamed): Hey, I was the one who found them!


Illyia(normal): If it weren’t for me, our “Leader” would be demon food!


Ayin(nervoussmile): Haha... 


Ayin(serious): Esaias, d-did you manage to find Dahlia?


Esaias(anxious): No, I could not locate her position. 


Esaias: Illyia, did you see her? She was headed in your direction.


Illyia(ashamed): No... I didn’t.


Esaias: That is... concerning. 


Esaias(lookingright): The only other route she could have taken in that direction leads to a stretch of completely unmapped tunnels...


Esaias: ...! 


Narrator: Esaias turns to look towards you.


Esaias(normal): Ayin, your Typocrypha seems to have several indicator lights on. 


Esaias: When was the last time you performed maintenance[e]?


Ayin(nervous): Uh, maintenance?


Illyia(serious): Oh my god, your Typocrypha’s ancient!


Illyia(laughing): What, did Austin Steiner build you that hunk of junk?


Ayin(nervoussmile): It was a hand-me-down from my dad. Not actually sure where he got it, though...


Esaias: I have some experience working with older models, although mostly learned second-hand from Dahlia. 


Esaias: I can take a look, if you wish.


Ayin(happy): Sure, thanks Esaias.


Esaias: .  .  .


Esaias(lookingright): ... Hmm, interesting. 


Esaias(normal): It seems your Typocrypha is equipped with an I-10 Spell Decoder module.


Ayin(surprised): A... What?


Esaias: After the Typocrypha design was streamlined with the inclusion of auto-complete and-


Illyia(serious): Weren’t we in a hurry, Egghead? 


Illyia: Finish up and let’s get going.


Esaias(embarrassed): Right. 


Esaias(normal): For now I’ve re-enabled the feature: it may prove useful in combat.


Ayin(serious): OK, how do I use it?


Esaias: Once a demon has been reduced to its spiritual form, you can activate-


>stopbgm


Narrator: A scream rings out from deeper in the Ruins.


Ayin(surprisedbad): That yell-


Esaias(anxious): It’s Dahlia!
