Clarke (militaryKaia): ATTENTION. All frontline units: group with your assigned parties and prepare for touchdown in 10 MINUTES. 


Clarke: EIN, you are assigned to PARTY I as JOB CLASS: TACTICIAN. This designates you as leader of your PARTY.


Clarke: The TACTICIAN Job Class is granted the RULE: AUTHORITY OF I. 


Clarke: As your RULE, to your discretion, your PARTY is subject to severe punishment under Agarthan law should they disobey your command.


Clarke: The following is an overview of PARTY I’s composition:

Clarke: Gather PARTY I in 9 MINUTES to the entrance of OBSCURAI.


Clarke: In prayer, grasp the sun, and DESTROY THE EVIL EYE.

Esaias (Default): You are Ein, correct?


Ein (Default): Yeah. And you are... Esaias?


Esaias (Default): Correct. It is a pleasure to meet you.


Dahlia (Default): Heya. I’m Dahlia. How you doing, Ein?


Esaias (default): Dahlia, we should be more formal to our leader.


Dahlia (Happy): Oh, I’m sure they don’t mind, Saia. 


/*Dahlia pulls Ein’s cheek*/


Ein (Uncomfortable): Wh- wrrgghh!


Dahlia (Happy): I mean, look at this baby face. Miles of difference from the General’s perpetual scowl.


Dahlia (Default): You were dragged into this like the rest of us, huh?


/*let go*/


Ein (Embarassed): Do I really look that green?


Dahlia (Happy): The greenest of the greenhorns!


Esaias (Default): Perhaps I should lend you my coat. Would suit your shade more.


Dahlia (Laughing): Bahaha! Oh, Esaias, never change.


Esaias (Comfortable): You, of all people, know I learn from the best. 


Ein (NervousSmile): (Guess they know each other.)


Dahlia (Happy): H-hey[a], don’t worry. We- er, well, I guess I play around, but I promise we won’t go behind your back.


Ein (Serious): I’d hope so. I wouldn’t want to use that RULE: AUTHORITY thing. 


Ein (Sheepish): (Though, if you did defect I wouldn’t hold it against you.)


Esaias (Default): Even so, we understand this is a life and death scenario. It is natural that we try to survive together. 


Ein (Default): Good to hear.

Clarke (militaryKaia): 6 MINUTES until commencement.


>removechar,Clarke


Ein (Squint): ...Hm. Where’s the last person? There’s someone else, right?


Dahlia (Default): That Breaker, Illyia, was it? 


Dahlia (Eyeroll): Well, whoever she is, it’s on her to find the assigned squad, not the lead.


Dahlia (Default): Maybe she ditched.


Esaias (LookingRight): I suggest we convene at the designated point.


Esaias (Default): It is our responsibility to follow procedure, regardless of stragglers.


Dahlia (Serious): Let’s get going.


Ein (Nervous): S-sure… 


Dahlia (Concerned): ...Hey, Ein?


Ein: Yeah?


Dahlia (Default): Just do your best with what you got. We’ll help you out, ok?


Ein (Happy): Mm. Thanks. I won’t let you all down.


/*Screen wipe to next bg*/


/*Illyia is standing*/


Illyia (Serious): ...Man, where the hell is my team… 


Ein (nervous): Uh, hey, Dahlia, isn’t that our missing Breaker? Wave her over!


Ein: Ah crap, she turned around-


Dahlia (default): Hey you! With the big hair!


>addchar,Illyia,-0.5,0


Illyia (pissed): Huh? Who’re you callin’ big head!?


Dahlia (sarcastic): I said BIG HAIR! Not head! That was supposed to be a compliment!?


Illyia (concerned): D-does it really stand out like that?


Dahlia: Not as much as the lass standing by her lonesome in a room of full parties...


Illyia (pissed): Hey, it ain’t on me that the party finder sucks!


Esaias (default): Illyia, was it?


Illyia (default): Yeah yeah. You’re Esaias, Dahlia, and Ein.


Esaias (default): Why were you waiting at the entrance before finding the leader?


Illyia (serious): Because I’m the leader.


Esaias: ...


Dahlia (Eyeroll): ...


Ein (concerned): ...Can she do that?


Illyia: I can convince you.


Dahlia (Eyeroll): Good lord, do we really have time for this…? You’ve lost your mind Illyia.


Illyia (pissed): H-hey! Sure I’m an idiot but at least I’ve been fighting more than this chucklehead!


Ein: For… how long?


Illyia (default): Years. Being an Exterminator has been all I lived for.


Illyia (serious): A newbie like you couldn’t begin to understand how important we are. We’re the future of Agartha!


Ein (nervous): Well, if I’m the future of Agartha, things are looking pretty bleak, huh?


Illyia (default): Yeah. So don’t worry, leave it to me!


Ein (uncomfortable): You know what, sure, you can take over-


Esaias: Ein, assert yourself. This is not in procedure.


Ein (nervous): Can’t I, as leader, just command you all to do it?


Esaias: It would reflect poorly on our GRADE to have a lax TACTICIAN.


Esaias: In fact, by this conversation, we may already be on record via surveillance.


Dahlia (serious): And that would mean… oh, SHIT, my- our payroll-


Ein (default): ...Alright alright. Sorry Illyia, but let me call the shots for a bit.


Illyia (pissed): And let you get all the credit? 


Ein (nervous): Why are you so pressed on this? What would you get out of this?


Illyia: Dammit, I need to show that I’m not fucking useless to my godamned-


/*SIREN*/

Clarke (militaryKaia): THE FALL COMMENCES. 1ST LINE, PROCEED TO YOUR POSITIONS AND BEGIN DESCENT.


>removechar,Clarke


Illyia (default): Whatever. Try to keep up, everyone.


Esaias: ...Okay.


Dahlia (serious): Agh, alright…


Ein (concerned): (This is gonna suck.)
