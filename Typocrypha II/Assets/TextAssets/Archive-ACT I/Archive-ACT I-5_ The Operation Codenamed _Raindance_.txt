Kaia “???”: 
15 years ago, a Demon Lord bearing the name of The Evil Eye rose from the Underground Land of Obscurai.


/*(BLACK COLOR WHOOSHES DOWN THE ELEVATOR. IN THE BACKGROUND, A SILHOUETTE OF THE EVIL EYE APPEARS IN THE LIGHT. MORE PEOPLE APPEAR ON THE ELEVATOR. ILLYIA CAN BE SEEN IN THE CROWD.)*/


Kaia "???": 
Wielding mastery over Darkness, the Evil Eye and its loyal demons of Obscurai sought to consume the Light of Agartha. 


/*(BLACK COLOR WHOOSHES DOWN THE ELEVATOR. IN THE BACKGROUND, A SILHOUETTE OF THE EVIL EYE AND A SUN APPEARS IN THE LIGHT. MORE PEOPLE APPEAR ON THE ELEVATOR. ADELAI CAN BE SEEN IN THE CROWD.)*/


Kaia "???":
Without Light, Humanity will rot in the Dark, Obscurians dancing on our corpses.


/*(BLACK COLOR WHOOSHES DOWN THE ELEVATOR. IN THE BACKGROUND, A SILHOUETTE OF PEOPLE FEARING THE EVIL EYE APPEARS IN THE LIGHT. MORE PEOPLE APPEAR ON THE ELEVATOR. DAHLIA CAN BE SEEN IN THE CROWD.)*/


Kaia "???":
But there are those who faced the Evil Eye, to defend the land they proudly called Home.


/*(BLACK COLOR WHOOSHES DOWN THE ELEVATOR. IN THE BACKGROUND, A SILHOUETTE OF PEOPLE RISING AGAINST THE EVIL EYE APPEARS IN THE LIGHT. MORE PEOPLE APPEAR ON THE ELEVATOR. ESAIAS CAN BE SEEN IN THE CROWD.)*/


Kaia "???":
Out of revenge, the Evil Eye cursed the heroes to be trapped forever in their own Home, never to see the Light of the Sun again.


/*(BLACK COLOR WHOOSHES DOWN THE ELEVATOR. IN THE BACKGROUND, A SILHOUETTE OF THE EVIL EYE CURSING AGARTHA APPEARS IN THE LIGHT. MORE PEOPLE APPEAR ON THE ELEVATOR.)*/


Kaia(Commanding) "???":
Children of the Lockdown, who seek true Light: you stand in the legacy of those heroes!


Kaia "???":
We, the humans of Agartha, have inherited the Curse of the Evil Eye!


Kaia "???":
And so it falls on us to break the Curse!


Kaia "???" (Zealous):
To embrace the true Sun once more!


Kaia "???":
To end the terror of Obscurai!


Kaia "???":
To exterminate that which plagues our sight!


Kaia "???":
Thus, we must-


/*(BLACK COLOR WHOOSHES DOWN THE ELEVATOR. BACKGROUND SHIFTS TO THE OPERATION ROOM)*/


CROWD:
Destroy the Evil Eye!
CROWD:
Destroy the Evil Eye!
CROWD:
DESTROY THE EVIL EYE!


Kaia "???" (normal):
Welcome, new recruits. I am acting Agarthan General Kaia Agnes, of the Agarthan Exterminators.


Kaia:
Several hours ago, the infamous Obscurian demon known as Gloam Knight broke through the Interlayer Railway, commanding legions of demons to attack the heart of Agartha: Ostanes.


/*(In the middle of the Operation Room, a screen displaying a diagram of the Ostanes building appears.)*/


Kaia:
As you all know, Ostanes is the manufacturer of the Typocrypha and all technology present in Agartha. 


Kaia:
Ostanes controls the power grid of the entire city. The loss of Ostanes means the breakdown of modern life. 


Kaia:
And today, we were dangerously close to witnessing it first hand.


/*(In the middle of the Operation Room, a screen displaying a logo of the Exterminators appears.)*/


Kaia:
You all may be wondering why you’ve all been gathered here today, and the answer is simple: the forces of Agartha have been decimated.


Kaia:
In the latest offensive against the Obscurai, the Obscurian King Balor unleashed a miasma that consumed over 80% of the Exterminators... killing them all instantly.


/***While Exterminators did die in this battle, in the chaos of this battle, a good portion of Exterminators also defect to Obscurai in this battle; the defected Exterminators are enemy Typocrypha users during the mid-game and will ultimately lead to the Party defecting, too. The defected Exterminators call themselves the EVIL EYE RESISTANCE, and assist in upholding the barriers to Obscurai.*/  


Kaia:
Ostanes has since labeled the event as the Balorian Massacre.


Kaia:
As the administrator of the Exterminators, their deaths have crushed my will to live. 


Kaia:
I curse my inability to save those taken by Balor, and so it is with hope that you all may avoid a similar fate.


/*(In the middle of the Operation Room, a screen displaying the Ostanes Construct Lab appears.)*/


Kaia:
...In addition to loss in personnel, the Gloam Knight had also successfully infiltrated the Ostanes Construct Lab. 


Kaia:
The Construct Lab houses all of Agartha’s military equipment and machinery.


Kaia: 
Were it still in stable condition, we could have deployed machines to fight in place of civilians; albeit at a high cost in magical energy.


Kaia:
But, alas, the Gloam Knight had taken machines from us, too.


Kaia:
And so, an emergency draft was called to enlist the common people of Agartha, and the various branches of AEIOU, under one banner.


Kaia (Commanding):
We will now commence briefing on your first mission:


/*(In the middle of the Operation Room, a screen displaying an icon of a raincloud appears.)*/


Kaia (Zealous):
OPERATION RAINDANCE!


Kaia (Commanding):
Warriors of Agartha’s Light, your mission is to penetrate the 1st barrier to the Land of Obscurai.


Kaia:
After the Balorian Massacre, the Obscurai proceeded to barricade their accursed nest.


Kaia:
The Obscurian line of defense consists of 4 barriers, each dividing the underground into 4 stratums.


Kaia:
At the very bottom of the 4 stratums is the Land of Obscurai, home to demonkind and the Evil Eye. No human has lived to tell the tale of its depths.


Kaia:
Through your power, we may be able to break through these barriers and Destroy the Evil Eye below.


Kaia:
However, it will not be easy, as each of the barriers is upheld by one of the Four Pillars of Obscurai.


Kaia:
Operation Raindance is named after the 1st Pillar: a Goddess of weather known as Mari.


Kaia:
Your objective for Operation Raindance is twofold:


Kaia:
First - defeat Mari of the Obscurai, and break the first barrier to Obscurai. 


Kaia:
Her destruction will render the barrier powerless, and thus divert Obscurian forces towards repairing the barrier instead of attacking Agartha directly as they have done today.


Kaia:
And second - collect Mana from fallen Demons by destroying their forms.


Kaia:
The Mana siphoned from Demons’ souls will go towards repairing the Ostanes Construct Lab and our battle machines.


Kaia (normal):
Should the Lab and its Constructs become restored... there is a high chance that you all may be dismissed from service.


Kaia (normal):
So, if you wish to seek a life of peace... 


Kaia (Commanding):
Then don’t hesitate! Take vengeance on the Demons who cursed us! Leave no one standing! 


Kaia (Zealous):
In the name of freedom, manifest your Destiny of Light, and cast away the Darkness of the Past!


Kaia:
For freedom!


Kaia:
FOR PEACE!


CROWD:
FOR THE LIGHT OF AGARTHA!


Kaia (confident):
Prepare yourselves.


Kaia (commanding):
Deployment begins immediately! Dismissed!
