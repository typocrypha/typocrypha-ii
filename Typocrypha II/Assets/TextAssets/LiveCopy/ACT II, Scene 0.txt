Ayin(5:00pm)[left]: Hello everyone! How is everyone doing? I thought it would be nice for us to keep in touch after the First Offensive, so I created this group chat!


Ayin(5:11pm)[left]: From my understanding, there is a good chance we will continue to remain on the same squad for the next phases of the Sanitization Project as well, so I look forward to working with all of you again!
