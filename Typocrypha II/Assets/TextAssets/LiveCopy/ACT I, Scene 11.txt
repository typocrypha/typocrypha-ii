Narrator: You pause for a moment,{pm} the adrenaline still pumping through your veins.


Narrator: The Ruins are quiet...


Narrator: It’s only you and Esaias.


Ayin(concerned): W-We’re OK now,{pm} right?


>playbgm,BGMAgarthanRuins


Esaias(anxious): Yes,{pm} there do not seem to be any more Demon responses.


Ayin(nervoussmile): Phew...{pm} Thanks for helping me out there,{ps} Esaias.


Esaias(normal): You are welcome.


Esaias(lookingleft): .{pl}.{pl}.


Esaias(normal): Ayin,{pm} why did you decide to join the AEIOU Academy?


Ayin(surprised): Huh?{pm} Oh,{pm} uh...


Ayin(nervous): I-{pm} there wasn’t really a big r-reason.


Ayin(embarrassed): My family didn’t have a whole lot of money,{pm} and AEIOU was recruiting so...


Ayin(surprised): Oh!{pm} And Adelai was there too.


Ayin(normal): Adelai is my friend,{pm} she’s also in the Sanitization project,{ps} but on the Attack team...


Ayin(nervous): So,{ps} uh,{pm} yeah...


Esaias(lookingright): I see.


Ayin(nervous): .{pl}.{pl}.


Esaias(normal): .{pl}.{pl}.


Ayin(ohfuck): D-{ps}Does that answer y-your question?


Esaias(embarrassed): Apologies,{pm} I should have been more straight to the point.


>setexpr,Ayin,serious


Esaias(normal): From the previous battle,{pm} you did not seem particularly well versed in combat.


Esaias(lookingleft): Including your lack of knowledge on Typocrypha and the Ruins...


>setexpr,Ayin,embarrassed


Esaias(normal): I suppose I was having difficulty understanding how you ended up in the Sanitization project.


Esaias(anxious): But I see now,{pm} thank you.


Ayin: Y-yeah,{pm} for sure!


Ayin(happy): Wh-What about you Esaias? 


Ayin(normal): You said you wanted to,{pm} um{pm}, “see the Ruins?”


Esaias(embarrassed): That was admittedly a crude summary of my goals.


Esaias(normal): As a child,{pm} I found myself enamored with the history of Agartha,{pm} and in particular the Ruins and their denizens,{pm} the Demons of Obscurai.


Esaias: However,{pm} AEIOU had already sealed the Ruins from before I was born,{pm} depriving me of any opportunity to see them for myself...


>setexpr,Ayin,serious


Narrator: 24 years ago...


Narrator: The day the Demons attacked Agartha -{pl} the “Awakening of the Evil Eye”.


Narrator: You too have lived your whole life under the Evil Eye’s gaze.


Narrator: Although it seems Esaias feels a little differently about it...


Esaias: As such,{pm} I immersed myself in books on the matter,{pm} at least as much as I could find.


Esaias(anxious): It is a tragedy how poorly maintained publicly available books on the Ruins are.{ps}[scroll-delay,0.02] Most of what one can find in libraries are limited to historical documents written by the early Armican settlers,{ps}[scroll-delay,0.01] but those accounts lack sufficient detail to...

Ayin(puppyeyes): .{pl}.{pl}.


Esaias(embarrassed): .{pl}.{pl}.apologies,{pm} I was rambling again.


Esaias: Dahlia has cautioned me that I tend to ramble in conversation.


Ayin(surprised): No,{pm} it’s fine!{pm} I like listening.


Ayin(nervoussmile): I think it’s cool how you can just know all these things.


Ayin(normal): So at least for me,{pm} you don’t have to apologize every time.


Esaias(normal): .{pl}.{pl}.


Esaias(normal): Yes,{pm} apolo-


Esaias(embarrassed): ...


Esaias(normal): Thank you,{pm} Ayin.


Esaias: We should regroup with Dahlia and Illyia.


Ayin(normal): Oh,{pm} y-yeah,{pm} let’s go.


>playbgm,BGMExplorer


Narrator: You head down the hallway in search of Illyia and Dahlia.


Narrator: It isn’t difficult -{pm} you just follow the sound of arguing.


>addchar,Illyia,0,0,right,pissed
>setexpr,Ayin,nervous


Illyia: That last one was my kill,{pm} Bob Cut!


>addchar,Dahlia,0,0,left,perish


Dahlia: You weren’t even looking!{pm} I saved you by taking it out!


Illyia: Yeah,{pm} and who asked you? 


Illyia(ashamed): Like I told you already,{pm} I can take care of myself!


Narrator: As you and Esaias approach the heated argument,{pm} Esaias turns to you.


Esaias(normal): Ayin,{pm} I believe you can exert your position as Captain to help resolve this.


Ayin(nervous): R-Really?{pm} They seem pretty into it...


Esaias(normal): Do not worry. 


Esaias: While I cannot speak much for Illyia,{pm} Dahlia has her own reasons for being on this mission that she would never risk over a petty argument.


Esaias(lookingright): While she can sometimes be quite...{pm} passionate.


Esaias(normal): She will listen to reason.


Ayin(serious): O-OK.


Narrator: You walk up to Illyia and Dahlia,{pm} still unnoticed.


Dahlia: And another thing-


>stopbgm


Ayin(uncomfortable): H-Hey!{pm} As the Captain,{pm} I think y-you two should stop arguing!


>setexpr,Dahlia,serious
>setexpr,Illyia,serious


Narrator: Illyia and Dahlia pause for a moment to look at you,{pm} stunned by your sudden interjection.


Ayin(nervous): Um,{pm} p-please?


>setexpr,Esaias,lookingleft


Narrator: Esaias shoots you a quick glare.


Ayin(serious): Ahem.


Ayin: For the mission,{pm} w-we need to move quickly to find the First barrier.


Ayin: If we keep arguing here,{pm} the other teams will end up finding the First Barrier before we do.


Ayin(ohfuck): S-So...


Dahlia: .{pl}.{pl}.


Illyia: .{pl}.{pl}.


>playbgm,BGMAgarthanRuins


Dahlia(concerned): ...ugh,{ps} yeah,{pm} sorry Ayin. 


Dahlia(happy): We should keep going.


Illyia(serious): Hmph,{pm} fine...


Ayin(nervoussmile): G-Good! 


Ayin(normal): Esaias,{pm} let’s keep going!


Esaias(normal): Understood,{pm} Captain.


Narrator: You feel a renewed sense of confidence in your team.


Narrator: Perhaps you will be the ones to find the First Barrier.


Narrator: As long as you stick together…
