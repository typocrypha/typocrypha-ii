Ayin(nervous): Ha... Ha...


Ayin(nervoussmile): H-Hey, everyone, we did it...


Narrator: You turn to look at your friends, but they’re in no shape to respond.


Narrator: You see Dahlia in the distance weakly tending to Esaias’s wounds.

Narrator: You want to join them yourself, but instead fall to your knees in exhaustion.


Narrator: They seem to be waving at you, but you can’t really tell.


Ayin: H-Hey! Don’t worry I’m... I’m O-OK.

Kaia: INCINERATE!


Adrestria: Gh-! You again!?


Kaia(commanding): Officer Adelai, fall back with the wounded.


Adelai(frustrated): But general, I can help!


Kaia: No. 


Kaia(confident): This one is mine.

Kaia(normal): Gloam Knight Adrestria. 


Kaia: I see you’ve decided to stop killing innocents and come down here for a real fight.


Kaia(confident): I, for one, am happy I get this chance at revenge.


Adrestria: ...!?


Adrestria: Revenge...?


Adrestria: What do YOU know of revenge, human?


Adrestria: After what you have done to us...


Adrestria: I’m going to make you pay for your crimes!!
