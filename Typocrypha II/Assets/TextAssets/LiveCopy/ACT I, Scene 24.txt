>addchar,Ayin,0,0,left,concerned


Ayin(concerned): Hnnngh...


Narrator: You slowly open your eyes to a bright white ceiling.


Narrator: Soft,{pm} artificial Agarthan sunshine leaks through the blinds.


Narrator: You really want to sleep in.


>addchar,Clarke,0,0,right


Clarke: Ayin!{pm} It is good to see that you’re awake!


Clarke: You have been asleep for 3 whole days -{pm} 1023% more than your average sleep time.


Clarke: I am sending a notification to the nurse immediately of your recovery.


>removechar,Clarke


Ayin(serious): Mmmmm...{pm} Hmm?


Narrator: You start to remember everything like a bad dream. 


Narrator: It comes back slowly -{pm} creeping at the edge of your thoughts.


Narrator: The Ruins,{pm} the First Barrier,{pm} you were trying to escape the Ruins,{pm} but there was so much chaos...


Narrator: The hospital room door slams open.

Adelai: AYIN!


Ayin(surprised): Adela-


Narrator: The wind is knocked out of you as Adelai crashes into you with a hug.


Ayin(surprisedbad): OOF!


Adelai: Ayin...


Narrator: You hear soft,{ps} muffled sobs,{pm} but Adelai doesn’t say anything.


Narrator: You stay like that for a while before Adelai detaches,{pm} stealthily wiping the tears from her face.


Adelai(teasing): *sniff*{pl} So,{pm} have a nice nap?


Ayin(embarrassed): Y-yeah...{pm} I guess?


Ayin(serious): .{pl}.{pl}.


Ayin: S-So it’s been 3 days,{pm} huh...


Adelai(defeated): Yeah,{pm} it’s been...{pm} A lot,{pm} handling the aftermath.


Narrator: You look at Adelai’s face -{pm} deep bags under her eyes,{pm} frayed hair in a messy ponytail.


Ayin(nervous): Aftermath?


Adelai(frustrated): Ah...


Narrator: Adelai holds something back -{pm} you’re not sure what.


Adelai(serious): You know,{pm} mostly just paperwork and stuff...


Adelai(default): But I’m sure you want to see your team members first,{pm} yeah?


Ayin(surprised): Th-that’s right!


Ayin(nervous): ...are they OK?


Adelai(caring): Well,{pm} why don’t you ask them yourself?


Adelai(default): In fact,{pm} I think your nurse should be here any second...


>movechar,Adelai,left,bottom
>addchar,Illyia,0,0,right,laughing


Illyia: Hey Captain! 


Narrator: Illyia enters the room on crutches with a wide grin on her face.


Narrator: You shudder at the thought of Illyia being your nurse.


Ayin(surprisedbad): I-Illyia!?


Illyia: Good to see you up and at ‘em Captain!


Illyia(normal): For a while it looked like you might not get up!


Ayin(ohfuck): {c,whisper}(What.){c}


Narrator: You hear rushed footsteps,{pm} as another familiar face arrives.


>addchar,Dahlia,0,0,right,perish


Dahlia: Illyia!{pm} What did I tell you about taking my calls!?


Illyia(normal): Aw,{pm} lighten up!{pm} I had to come to celebrate our Captain’s heroic return!


Dahlia(eyeroll): Sigh,{pm} anyways...


Dahlia(happy): Ayin!{pm} How are you feeling?


Ayin(nervoussmile): Dahlia!{pm} I-I’m OK.


Ayin(happy): It’s good to see that you’re both OK!


Illyia(laughing): Ha!{pm} It’ll take more than that to take me out!


Illyia(ashamed): I told them I could keep fighting but...


Dahlia(eyeroll): Illyia,{pm} you had 3 broken ribs,{pm} a broken ankle,{pm} and a sprained wrist.


Illyia: I don’t want to hear that from the person who reset their broken leg on the battlefield!


Narrator: You watch Illyia and Dahlia bicker for a moment.


Narrator: When did they get so chummy?


>setexpr,Dahlia,normal


Ayin(surprised): Oh,{pm} and by the way this is my friend-


>stopbgm


Illyia(serious): Adelai Steiner.


Adelai(serious): Illyia Xiong.


Narrator: The two stare each other down,{pm} seeming like they could break out into a duel at any moment.


Narrator: But instead...


Illyia(ashamed): ...thanks,{pm} for the,{pm} uh,{pm} backup n’ all...


Adelai(interested): ...!


>playbgm,BGMSecondHand(Redux)


Adelai(teasing): Ayin,{pm} are you sure this is the real Illyia? 


Adelai: Like she didn’t get body swapped by a Changeling?


Illyia(serious): Take it or leave it,{pm} Steiner!


Illyia: .{pl}.{pl}.


Illyia(ashamed): I’m going back to bed...


>removechar,Illyia


Dahlia: Huh,{pm} I didn’t think many people could stand toe-to-toe with Illyia like that.


Adelai(teasing): Hehe...{pm} Well,{pm} if this was the Illyia I knew from the Exterminators,{pm} that confrontation might’ve ended a lot differently.


Dahlia(normal): You two worked together?


Adelai(normal): Same unit,{pm} actually,{pm} under General Kaia.


Adelai(interested): There was a...{pm} little accident,{pm} and she got transferred to a different unit.


Adelai(teasing): She’s still as prickly as always but,{pm} I don’t know,{pm} she’s softened a little bit.


Adelai(normal): Anyways,{pm} I have to head back -{pm} still lots of work to do.


Adelai: Take care of Ayin,{pm} uh-


Dahlia(happy): Dahlia Bulsara,{pm} she/her pronouns,{pm} medic class. 


Dahlia(laughing): And yes,{pm} you can leave our Captain with us!


Adelai(caring): Thank you,{pm} Dahlia.{pm} Talk with you later,{pm} Ayin!


Ayin(normal): Yeah,{pm} talk soon.


>removechar,Adelai


Dahlia(happy): Aah,{pm} so that was the friend you were talking about.


Dahlia: I saw her peeking into your room from time to time.


Dahlia(normal): I think she was really worried.


Ayin(embarrassed): Haha,{pm} is that so...


Ayin(surprised): Wait,{pm} where’s Esaias?


Dahlia(concerned): Saia?{pm} Oh,{pm} he’s OK,{ps} but uh...


>stopbgm


Narrator: Dahlia pauses


Dahlia: He’s OK and conscious now but,{pm} I think he’s still pretty shaken.


Dahlia(normal): Taking a look at your vitals,{pm} everything seems OK.


Dahlia(happy): Once you rest up a bit,{pm} why don’t you go say hi to him?


Dahlia: Might lift his spirits.


Ayin(serious): Yeah...

Narrator[middle](center): The following day...

>clear
>playbgm,BGMSuave
>addchar,Ayin,0,0,left,serious


Narrator: You arrive at Esaias’s room -{pm} near identical to yours.


>addchar,Esaias,0,0,right,lookingright


Narrator: You see Esaias lying in bed with his leg propped up in a cast.


Narrator: Esaias sees you come in,{pm} but immediately averts his gaze.


Ayin(sheepish): H-Hey Esaias.{pm} How are you doing?


Esaias: .{pl}.{pl}.


Esaias: Dahlia said my leg will probably take a few weeks to heal.


Ayin(ohfuck): I-I see...


Narrator: An awkward silence fills the air. 


Narrator: You never know what to do when this happens.


Narrator: You hastily scramble for a topic.


Ayin(normal): ...Oh!{pm} Uh,{pm} Esaias,{pm} if you’re OK,{pm} could you take a look at my Typocrypha?


Esaias: .{pl}.{pl}.


Esaias(normal): Let me take a look.


Narrator: You hand Esaias your Typocrypha. 


Narrator: Esaias’s expression seems to lighten when given this distraction.


Esaias: Ayin,{pm} it does not seem like your Typocrypha can even turn on in this state.


Esaias(anxious): The magic circuitry is completely fried,{pm} half the keys on the keyboard have melted off,{pm} and...


Esaias(embarrassed): Ahem...


Esaias(lookingright): I recommend you purchase a new Typocrypha.


Ayin(sheepish): Well,{pm} I don’t have a whole lot of money on hand unfortunately... 


Ayin(ohfuck): {c,whisper}(Also it’s technically my dad’s...){c}


Ayin(serious): Would it really be that difficult to repair?


Esaias: Dahlia would know better than I would. 


Esaias(lookingleft): .{pl}.{pl}.


Esaias: I recommend you ask her.


Ayin(sheepish): Oh,{pm} sure...


>stopbgm


Narrator: You reach out to take back your Typocrypha,{pm} but something about Esaias’s expression makes you pause.


Narrator: You’ve never been great at interpreting expressions,{pm} but you’ve also never been through several life-or-death situations with someone before.


Narrator: You feel a connection with Esaias.


Narrator: You decide to make a small push.


Ayin(normal): Actually,{ps} E-Esaias,{pm} I want you to work on it.


>playbgm,BGMEsaiasTheme


Esaias(lookingright): .{pl}.{pl}.


Esaias(anxious): Why?{pm} Dahlia is a much more skilled engineer than I.


Esaias: I do not understand why you would go against my recommendation like this.


Narrator: You think Esaias is...{pm} Angry?


Ayin: I mean,{pm} you helped me before in the Ruins,{pm} remember?


Esaias: That was nothing.


Esaias(lookingright): Anyone with even a cursory understanding of Typocrypha could do that.


Narrator: He’s disappointed in himself?


Narrator: But behind it all...


Ayin(nervoussmile): But Dahlia will be busy with her medic duties, right?


>setexpr,Esaias,normal
Narrator: Esaias turns to look at you.


Ayin(sheepish): Well,{ps} I mean,{pm} you know you don’t HAVE to do it.


Ayin(nervous): I just thought like,{pm} uh...


Esaias(lookingleft): .{pl}.{pl}.


Esaias(embarrassed): I will try.


>setexpr,Esaias,lookingleft
Ayin(surprised): O-Oh,{pm} uh,{pm} cool!


Ayin(sheepish): S-Sounds good! 


Ayin: Yeah,{pm} just let me know whenever you’re done!


Narrator: Esaias doesn’t say anything,{pm} but as you leave,{pm} you think you see a small smile...


Narrator: And with that,{pm} the baton has been passed...
