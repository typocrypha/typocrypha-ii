Adelai: Ayin!


Ayin(surprised): A-Adelai?{ps} Why are you-


Narrator: [screen-shake,2,0.5] Adelai tackles you with a tight hug.


Narrator: She stays like that for a long moment before finally letting go.


Adelai(caring): Well,{pm} you didn’t answer any of my messages... 


Adelai(teasing):[d] Bet you couldn’t tell it was me,{ps} right?


Ayin(sheepish): Uh,{pl} y-yeah...


Ayin(uncomfortable): ...


Narrator: As the freshness of the unexpected meeting begins to dissipate,{pm} Adelai changes her tone as well.


>stopbgm


Adelai(serious): Ayin...


Adelai(interested): ...


Narrator: Adelai silently hands you a manila folder.


Adelai: It’s your mission briefing.


Ayin(surprisedbad): !!


Ayin(uncomfortable): S-So you’re here to force me into the draft after all...


Adelai(serious): It’s either that or get sent to prison for deserting,{ps} Ayin!


Adelai: Just imagine if it wasn’t me coming here to deliver your orders...


Adelai(normal): ...and besides,{pm} I think once you take a look,{pm} you might feel a little better.


>setexpr,Ayin,serious


Narrator: Reluctantly,{pm} you open the folder and begin paging through the briefing.


>playbgm,BGMMysterious


Narrator: “Operation Raindance”


Narrator: Goal -{pl} Destroy the {c,ui-terms}First Barrier{c},{pm} one of three barriers blocking passage to the Evil Eye.


Narrator: 26 small scouting teams will be sent into the first layer of the Ruins to locate the {c,ui-terms}First Barrier{c},{pm} whose exact location is currently unknown.


Narrator: Once a scouting team locates the First Barrier,{pm} they are to plant a {c,ui-terms}locator{c} beacon to signal the main attack team to strike.


Narrator: Assignment for Ayin A. -{pl} Captain for Scouting Team Z.


Ayin(surprised): Captain!{pm} Me?


Adelai(bffs4ever): Pretty cool,{ps} right?


Ayin(uncomfortable): N-no!{pm} How did I even end up captain...


Adelai(teasing): Well you did take out a bunch of demons during the Seven Stars attack,{ps} remember?


Adelai: And then maybe someone included that fact in their report...


Ayin(nervous): Oh...


Adelai(normal): Anyways!{pm} Look,{pm} you’re just in the scouting team!


Ayin(squint): And why is that a good thing?


Ayin: Won’t I be sent deep into the Ruins?


Adelai(interested): W-Well,{pm} it’s at least not the front lines...


Adelai(teasing): And if you run into a bunch of demons,{pm} you can just run away!


Adelai(interested): Err,{pm} well maybe not just run away,{pm} but there would probably be another path right?


Adelai(ifonly): A-and,{ps} you have 25 other teams also looking,{pm} so...


>stopbgm


Ayin: .{pl}.{pl}.


Adelai: .{pl}.{pl}.


Adelai(frustrated): OK Ayin,{pm} yeah,{pm} it’ll be dangerous.


>playbgm,BGMSecondHand


Adelai(frustrateddistant): I can’t promise it’ll be easy.


Narrator: Adelai takes out a small metal tube from her bag -{pl} the locator beacon from the briefing.


Narrator: She places the beacon firmly in your hand.


Adelai(serious): Which is why,{ps} Ayin,{pm} you have to be the one to find the First Barrier.


Ayin(uncomfortable): But before you were saying-


Adelai: Because!{pm} Once you do,{pm} and you activate that beacon.


Adelai: I promise you,{pm} I will be there to protect you.


>setexpr,Ayin,serious


Adelai (interested): I was assigned to the main attack teams -{pl} the ones who will come in and destroy the First Barrier once the scouting teams find it.


Adelai(frustrateddistant): I wanted to be on the scouting team with you,{pm} but my request was...{pl} denied.


Adelai: So this is the only way I can protect you...


Ayin(nervous): Adelai,{pm} I-I can’t do this...


Adelai(serious): You CAN do it,{pm} Ayin!


>setexpr,Ayin,uncomfortable


Adelai:.{pl}.{pl}.


Adelai(normal): Hey,{pm} you remember that practical assignment we had last year?


Ayin(squint): ?


Adelai: It was a live battle simulation -{pm} a free-for-all. 


Adelai(serious): We were graded based on how many hits we got off on the other students.


Adelai(teasing): And your grade was a historical moment for the class!


Adelai: The first{pl} perfect{pl} 0!


Ayin(ohfuck): O-Oh yeah...


Adelai(serious): ...but!


>setexpr,Ayin,serious


Adelai(caring): Also the first time someone survived the entire test without getting hit even once.


Ayin(surprisedbad): That was just cause I w-was panicking in a corner!


Ayin(uncomfortable): I just got lucky nobody found me...


>stopbgm


Narrator: There’s a moment of silence,{pm} before Adelai’s caring expression suddenly turns upset.


Adelai(serious): Ayin,{pm} you’ve been studying and working hard at the Academy for 4 years now![e]


Adelai(frustrateddistant): Sure your grades aren’t the highest...


Adelai(serious): But you’ve stuck it out while countless others have already dropped out!


Adelai: You know how to fight,{pm} Ayin!


Ayin(uncomfortable): But-


Adelai: Ayin.


Narrator: Adelai looks directly at you,{pm} her voice shaking ever so slightly.


Adelai(caring): You have to do this,{ps} Ayin.


>setexpr,Ayin,serious


Adelai(ifonly): For Agartha,{pm} for yourself,{pm} and...


Narrator: Adelai pauses and 


Adelai(serious): You have to help set us free,{pm} Ayin.


Adelai(caring): So please,{pm} I know you’re scared,{pm} but can’t you trust me to have your back?


Narrator: You flash back to all of your time with Adelai.


Narrator: All of the times Adelai’s helped you study and supported you when you were down.


Narrator: Even when you didn’t believe in yourself,{pm} Adelai did.


Narrator: The locator beacon weighs heavy in your hand.


Narrator: You tighten your grip.
