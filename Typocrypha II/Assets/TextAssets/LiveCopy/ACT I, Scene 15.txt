Narrator: The demons escape into a nearby corridor.


Illyia: Hey! Get back here-


Esaias: Illyia, stop. We need to treat Dahlia. 


Esaias(normal): Help me carry her somewhere safe.


Illyia(pissed): Hey, you don’t tell me-


Esaias(anxious): Please. 


Esaias: ...Help me.


Illyia(ashamed): ...Fine.


Narrator: You all help carry Dahlia over to a nearby alcove.


Narrator: Looking closer, her leg is extremely swollen. 


Narrator: You’re no doctor, but even you can tell it’s probably broken.


Dahlia: ...Hngh...


Esaias(normal): D-Dahlia...


Dahlia(happy): I-It’s not that bad, don’t worry!


Dahlia(stressed): Gh-!


Esaias(lookingright): Try not to move too much, Dahlia.


Esaias(normal): ...


Esaias: We need to retreat to the surface.


Illyia(pissed): What!? We can’t just retreat!


Esaias(anxious): Dahlia is hurt. She cannot continue!


Illyia: You two can just carry her.


Esaias: And you will defeat all of the demons? While protecting us? I find that difficult to believe.


Illyia: Well why don’t you-

Dahlia: ^shake^AAAGHhh...!|shake|


Esaias: Dahlia! Wha-What did you do?


Dahlia(stressed): D-don’t worry... Saia. I-I’ve reset broken bones like this a hundred times before.


>playbgm,BGMSecondHand


Dahlia(happy): Although... Never on myself, haha...


Dahlia(stressed): Gh-!


Esaias(anxious): Dahlia, you should rest-


Dahlia(serious): No, Saia. We’re continuing the mission.


Esaias: But...


Dahlia(happy): Saia, I’ll be fine, OK?


Illyia(concerned): Damn, Bobcut. Didn’t know you had it in you-


>setexpr,Ayin,surprised


Dahlia(perish): And you!


>stopbgm


Narrator: Dahlia pulls herself up against the wall and hobbles towards Illyia.


Narrator: You watch in awe as she grabs Illyia by the collar, staring right into her eyes.


Dahlia(stressed): My name... 


Dahlia: Is DAHLIA.


Dahlia(perish): Got it!?


Illyia(ashamed): ...!!


Illyia: Uh, I...


Illyia(concerned): Y-yeah, sure.


Dahlia(perish): Say it!


Illyia(concerned): D-Dahlia...


Dahlia(happy): ...Good!


Dahlia: Alright Saia. What direction are we heading next?
