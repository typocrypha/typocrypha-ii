Illyia(serious): Damn demon...


Illyia(concerned): Hey “Leader”, you OK?


Ayin(ohfuck): I-Illyia? I... 


>playbgm,BGMExposition


Narrator: Your breathing quickens. It’s happening again.


Ayin: I, I can’t-


Illyia(pissed): Woah, don’t go losing it on me.


Ayin(uncomfortable): I’m sorry, I can’t anymore. I-


Narrator: Illyia lifts you up by the shoulders (quite easily) and starts shaking you.


Illyia: Hey. HEY! Look at me.


Illyia(serious): Breathe!


Narrator: Illyia stares right at you, but behind her fierce visage, you sense a surprising warmth.


>stopbgm


Ayin(serious): (Breathe in... Breathe out...)


Ayin: ...


Ayin(sheepish): Sorry, Illyia... I-I feel a little better now.


Ayin: What are you doing here anyways, Illyia?


Illyia(serious): Saving your ass, obviously!


Illyia(ashamed): Well, not just you, I guess...


Ayin(nervous): W-What do you mean?


Illyia: ...


Illyia(serious): I was the only person who made it back to the rendezvous point.


>playbgm,BGMCurse


Ayin(surprisedbad): What?!


Illyia: ...We need to get going.


Narrator: Illyia doesn’t say anymore, but seeing her condescending glare makes the situation clear enough.


Narrator: Illyia chose to save you first - even though you’re not the strongest, and can’t navigate, and can’t even heal wounds...


Narrator: ...but because you’re the leader - because that was the role you were given.


Narrator: What a worthless title for a person like you.


Narrator: You can hear clearly in your mind Illyia’s unspoken insults...

Clarke: WARNING! WARNING! DEMON ATTACK IMMINENT!


Narrator: ...and mixed in, the mocking laughter of the Demons, giving you no time to catch your breath.
