Illyia: Look at me.


Illyia(serious): Breathe!

Ayin(serious): (Breathe in...{pm} Breathe out...)


Ayin(sheepish): Thanks,{ps} Illyia...{pm} I-I feel a little better now.

Illyia: We need to get going.


Narrator: Illyia doesn’t say anymore,{pm} but seeing her condescending glare makes the situation clear enough.


Narrator: Illyia chose to save you first -{pm} even though you’re not the strongest,{pm} and can’t navigate,{pm} and can’t even heal wounds...


Narrator: ...but because you’re the leader -{pm} because that was the role you were given.


Narrator: What a worthless title for a person like you.


Narrator: You can hear clearly in your mind Illyia’s unspoken insults...
