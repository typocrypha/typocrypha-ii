Narrator: The train arrives at “The End of the Line” -{pl} the aptly named main entrance to the labyrinthian Ruins snaking beneath Agartha.


>playsfx,SFXRingtone


Ayin: ...!


Narrator: Your Typocrypha starts to ring.


>addchar,Clarke,0,0,right


Clarke: Hello Ayin! 


Clarke: {c,ui-terms}Operation “Raindance”{c} begins in 24 minutes and 39 seconds.


Clarke: Why have you not rendezvoused with your team yet?


Ayin(nervoussmile): Uh,{pm} hehe,{pm} w-where was that again?


Clarke: .{pl}.{pl}.


Clarke: You have been assigned to Scouting Team Z.


Clarke: Listing all team members and associated roles...


Narrator: Your Typocrypha lists out your team members.


Narrator: Ayin A. (ID:NB) -{pl} CAPTAIN
Narrator: Illyia X. (ID:F) -{pl} FORWARD GUARD
Narrator: Dahlia B. (ID:F) -{pl} MEDIC
Narrator: Esaias W. (ID:M) -{pl} NAVIGATOR


Clarke: In the interest of time,{pm} I have provided your teammates with your current position. 


Clarke: They should be joining you shortly from the neighboring train cars.


Ayin(nervoussmile): O-OK,{pm} thanks...


Ayin(serious): Um,{pm} could you also look up another person?


Clarke: Certainly!


Ayin: Adelai Steiner.


Clarke: Searching.{pl}.{pl}.


Narrator: Adelai S. -{pl} FORWARD GUARD -{pl} Attack Team


Ayin(concerned): Do you know where the Attack Team is meeting up?


Clarke: The Attack Team has already descended and is standing by in the main atria of the Ruins.


Clarke: Your team will be infiltrating through a separate side tunnel to scout out the location of the {c,ui-terms}First Barrier{c,ui-terms}.


Ayin: Side tunnel?


Clarke: Agent Ayin,{pm} have you read the mission briefing?


Ayin(ohfuck): Uh,{ps} y-yeah!{pm} Of course,{ps} haha...


Clarke: .{pl}.{pl}.


Clarke: OK!


Clarke: Good luck,{pm} Ayin!

Narrator: In the distance,{pm} you see two people start moving towards you.


Narrator: One of them starts waving as if you were an old friend.


>setexpr,Ayin,nervous


Narrator: You awkwardly avert your gaze.


Dahlia(normal): Oh,{pm} excuse me!


Ayin(surprised): Y-Yes?


Dahlia(laughing): You’re Ayin,{pm} right? 


Dahlia: We’re your other teammates.{pl} Nice to meet you!


Dahlia(happy): I’m {c,ui-terms}Dahlia Bulsara{c},{ps} but you can just call me Dahlia.{pm} I use she/her pronouns. 


Dahlia: And while I’ve been assigned as the medic,{pm} I’m no stranger to combat,{ps} so you can count on me for backup!


Esaias: I would recommend we stick closely to our assigned roles for the mission.


Dahlia(normal): Ah,{pm} you gotta loosen up,{ps} Saia!


Dahlia(sarcastic): It’s not like you’re going to be just staring at a map the whole time we’re down there.


Esaias(anxious): Actually,{pm} the layout of the Ruins of Obscurai is extremely complicated.


Esaias(lookingleft): Due to electro-magical interference,{pm} we will be unable to use any form of automated guidance when inside.


Esaias(lookingright): Furthermore,{pm} current maps of the Ruins are horribly inaccurate and-


Dahlia(happy): OK OK,{pm} I’ll stop you right there. 


Dahlia(serious): Why don’t you introduce yourself to our new captain first,{ps} yeah?


Esaias(embarrassed): ...apologies.


Esaias(normal): I am {c,ui-terms}Esaias Walker{c},{pm} Navigator.{pl} He/him pronouns.


Esaias: Please do not hesitate to ask if you require any additional information on the Ruins.


Ayin(sheepish): Uh,{ps} sure!


Ayin(surprised): ...Oh!{pm} Right,{pm} my name! 


Ayin(nervous): You can,{pm} uh,{pm} j-just call me Ayin...?


Ayin(ohfuck): I,{ps} um,{pm} I use they/them pronouns...


Dahlia(laughing): You don’t have to be so nervous,{ps} Ayin!


Dahlia(normal): I mean,{pm} we’re just scouting the place out.


>setexpr,Ayin,serious


Esaias(anxious): Agreed.{pl} If you look here...


Narrator: Esaias brings up a map projection on his Typocrypha.


Narrator: It is,{pm} to Esaias’s credit,{pm} horribly complicated and you don’t understand much of it.


Esaias(normal): Our planned path will follow along an old Obscurian aqueduct,{pm} which was abandoned years before the construction of the surrounding atria allowing us to exploit the-


Dahlia(sarcastic): Uh,{ps} Sai?{pm} Maybe just the short version for now...


Esaias(embarrassed): ...apologies again.


// TODO: Map hides.


Esaias(normal): In short,{pm} we should not encounter significant Demon resistance.


Dahlia(happy): See?{pm} We’ll get in there,{pm} find the First Barrier,{pm} and will be back in the rear while the Attack Team handles the rest.


Narrator: The Attack Team with Adelai in it.


Ayin(nervoussmile): Y-Yeah...{pm}


Narrator: You begin to think,{pm} with these two,{pm} things might be OK after all.


>stopbgm


Narrator: Just as you’re thinking this,{pm} another person walks up to your group. 


>addchar,Illyia,0,0,right,serious


Narrator: She doesn’t look at you in the eyes,{pm} seeming to look farther into the distance.


Narrator: She kind of reminds you of Adelai.


>setexpr,Ayin,nervous
Illyia(serious): .{pl}.{pl}.


Dahlia(normal): Oh,{ps} you must be Illyia!


Dahlia(happy): Hi,{ps} I’m Da-


Illyia(concerned): Yeah yeah,{ps} I reviewed all of your profiles.


Illyia: Two civilian volunteers and an Academy grunt...


Illyia(ashamed): Just my luck... 


Dahlia(serious): ...excuse me?


>playbgm,BGMMilitary


Illyia(pissed): Alright,{ps} listen up! 


Illyia: We’re changing our planned route.


Illyia(serious): From Point A,{pm} we’ll cut through Sub-Atrium D to get to the main Chamber.


Illyia: It’ll be faster{ps} and we’ll be able to cover more ground to find the First Barrier.


Illyia(ashamed): Any questions?


Narrator: You find yourself at a loss for words -{pl} partially because you didn’t really understand what Illyia just said.


Narrator: Esaias is the first to break the silence.


Esaias(whut): Illyia?{pm} If I may...


Esaias(anxious): If we take that route,{pm} we will encounter significantly more Demon resistance.


Illyia(pissed): What?{pm} You scared of a few Demons?


Illyia(serious): Just don’t worry about it and follow my lead.


Dahlia(stressed): Hey,{ps} what’s your problem?


Dahlia: You’re not the captain!


Illyia(normal): ...you know what,{pm} you’re right. 


Illyia: I’m not the captain.


Illyia(serious): Me?{pm} The one with years of Demon combat experience?{pm} I’m just another soldier.


Illyia(pissed): But the draftee who’s still in Academy?{pm} Of course they get to be captain!


Dahlia: Look,{pm} that doesn’t mean-


>stopbgm


Ayin(uncomfortable): I-I’ll give it to you!


Dahlia(concerned): !!


Ayin(serious): Illyia,{pm} you can be team captain. 


Ayin: I-I’ll transfer the designation.


Illyia(quietlyhappy): Hmph,{pm} it’s good to see at least one of you has some common sense.


Ayin: Clarke,{pm} transfer role CAPTAIN to Illyia.


>addchar,Clarke,0,0,left


Clarke: Transfer request -{pm} DENIED.


Illyia(pissed): What!? 


Clarke: REASON:{pl} Illyia Xiong has been put on observation per General {c,ui-terms}Iris Xiong’s{c} request.


Clarke: Agents on observation are prohibited from taking team designation status of CAPTAIN.


Illyia(serious): ^shake^Iris?!|shake|{pm} That bitch...


Illyia(pissed): First you take me off the Attack Team and now this?


Dahlia(sarcastic): Well well,{ps} it’s good to see that the higher ups have some common sense,{ps} keeping a tight leash on a hothead like you.


Illyia(serious): You shut up right now or I’ll-


Clarke: NOTICE:{pl} Operation “Raindance”, begins in 10 minutes and 55 seconds. 


Clarke: All scouting teams please prepare to descend into the Ruins.


>removechar,Clarke


Illyia(ashamed): .{pl}.{pl}.


Narrator: Without a word,{pm} Illyia heads towards the train doors.


>removechar,Illyia
>playbgm,BGMExplorer


Dahlia: Jeez,{pm} she sure is a hot mess.


Dahlia(eyeroll): Sigh...{pm} But we shouldn’t let her go off by herself,{ps} I guess.


Dahlia(normal): Ah,{ps} and don’t worry too much about the captain stuff Ayin. 


Dahlia(happy): Saia and I got your back!


Esaias(whut): Agreed.{pm} I am still in disbelief that she thought cutting through Sub-Atrium D would be better than my planned route!


Esaias(anxious): The Demon interference alone would cost-


Dahlia(perish): Ahem-!


Esaias(embarrassed): -Ah...{pm} We will support you Ayin.


Ayin(ohfuck): G-Got it,{pm} thanks...
