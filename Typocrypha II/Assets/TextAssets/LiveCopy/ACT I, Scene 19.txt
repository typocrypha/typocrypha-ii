Narrator: A chill races down your spine.


Narrator: Frost spreads across the walls and floors from a far corridor.


Narrator: You turn to look, and see a giant snake demon slither out from the hall.

Mari: Ohhh, ohhhhh...


Mari: Cursed humans... Are you blind to the destruction you have caused?


Mari: Leave this sacred ground... NOW!


Dahlia: It’s... Another demon?


Illyia(pissed): What, just one more? I’ll take care of it!


Narrator: You watch Illyia charge at the demon, only to be sent flying by a sudden gust of wind into a wall.


Illyia(serious): -ACK!


>removechar,Illyia


Ayin(surprisedbad): Illyia!!


Esaias(anxious): I- I-


Narrator: Esaias turns to run, but isn’t fast enough.


Narrator: The demon materializes a shard of ice in the air, and pierces Esaias in the leg, sending him to the ground.


Esaias: -GAAH!


>removechar,Esaias


Dahlia: Esaias!!


Narrator: Dahlia rushes to treat Esaias’s wound.


>removechar,Dahlia


Mari: Demons and humans... We may never return to how we once were...


Narrator: The demon lets out a harrowing scream, creating vicious whirlwinds throughout the chamber.


Narrator: The winds push back the reinforcements your team desperately needs.


Narrator: You’re all alone now.


Narrator: And then, the demon looks straight at you[c].

[a]can probably also bleed over from victory screen in battle
[b]might be cool to have them break through the center of the dialog (sort of like talking with monster in undertale during battle where they're centered with text boxes)
[c]if we ever use different transitions, this would be the moment to use swirly transition
