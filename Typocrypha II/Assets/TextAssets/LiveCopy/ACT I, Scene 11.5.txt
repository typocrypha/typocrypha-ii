NarratorSilent: Captain’s log -{pm} Scouting Team Z.


NarratorSIlent: 13:32,{pm} 4.5 hours since the start of operation.[a]


NarratorSilent: We have progressed halfway through the Ruins towards where we believe the First Barrier is.


NarratorSilent: There has been a larger Demon presence than expected,{pm} however we have so far had no major casualties.


NarratorSilent: .{pl}.{pl}.


Ayin: {c,ayin}“...”{c}


Ayin(ohfuck): {c,ayin}”(Uhh...{pm} What else do I write in these things?)”{c}


>clear


NarratorSilent: Team morale is high.


Dahlia(stressed): {c,dahlia}”Hey,{ps} Illyia!{pm} That was my ration!”{c}


Illyia(pissed): {c,illyia}”I’m the Forward Guard,{pm} you’re just the Medic!{pm} I burn more calories than you!”{c}


NarratorSilent: Team morale is OK.


>clear


NarratorSilent: The team remains focused on our goal to find the First Barrier.


Esaias(normal): {c,esaias}”Ayin,{pm} look!”{c}


Ayin(surprisedbad): {c,ayin}”Wh-What is it Esaias?{pm} Is it more Demons!?”{c}


Esaias(embarrassed): {c,esaias}”The writing on these tablets are of a quality I have never seen before!{pm} If I had to hazard a guess,{pm} these were markers used by the Obscurians to help navigate and..."{c}


Ayin(concerned): {c,ayin}”...”{c}


NarratorSilent: As Captain,{pm} I have faith that our team will be able to find the First Barrier.


NarratorSilent: As long as we stick together...

Narrator: You look up from your Typocrypha to see the team stopped at a four-way fork in the tunnel.


Narrator: Esaias is staring at his map equally perplexed.


>setexpr,Ayin,serious


Esaias(anxious): Based on my maps,{pm} one of these paths should lead us further into the Ruins...


Illyia(concerned): And let me guess,{pm} you don’t know which one.


Esaias(embarrassed): N-No...


Illyia(ashamed): Of course you don’t,{pm} why’d I even bother asking?


Dahlia(stressed): Hey,{pm} don’t lash out at Saia!


Dahlia(sarcastic): Not like you know which way to go!


Illyia(normal): But I do know how to find out.


Illyia(quietlyhappy): Four doors and four people -{pm} you do the math.


Illyia: We split up and report back here in 30 minutes.


Dahlia(serious): We can’t do that!{pm} What if there are more Demons?


Illyia(serious): Then you handle them. 


Illyia: We’re all soldiers,{pm} aren’t we?


>setexpr,Ayin,ohfuck


Narrator: Illyia shoots you a nasty look.


>setexpr,Ayin,serious


Dahlia(concerned): Esaias,{pm} what do you think?


Esaias(lookingleft): .{pl}.{pl}.


>setexpr,Ayin,serious


Esaias(normal): I agree with Illyia.


Esaias(anxious): If I only had a little more data on the paths ahead,{pm} I should be able to deduce the correct path forward.


Esaias(normal): 30,{pm} no...{pm} 15 minutes of scouting down each path should be more than enough to get a sense of the layout.


Illyia(normal): See?{pm} Our Navigator seems to agree!


Dahlia(concerned): I’m still against this,{pm} we’ve run into so many Demons already.


Ayin: .{pl}.{pl}.


Ayin(nervous): I-I think we should split up too.


Dahlia(serious): Are you sure,{pm} Ayin?{pm} I could go with you-


Illyia(normal): Ah,{pm} our “brave leader” can handle themselves,{pm} right?


Ayin(nervoussmile): Y-Yeah...


Ayin(normal): Thanks Dahlia,{pm} but it’s just a short scouting trip, right?


Ayin(nervous): A-And if something happens,{pm} I can always just run back here...


Esaias(normal): Actually,{pm} for the purposes of data collection,{pm} it would be better if you could fight the Demons to continue...


Ayin(ohfuck): {c,whisper}(gulp...!){c}


Illyia(laughing): Alright,{pm} then it’s decided!


Illyia(normal): We’ll meet back here at 13:50 on the dot.


Illyia: Off we go!


>removechar,Illyia


Dahlia(concerned): Sigh...{pm} Ayin,{pm} just be careful,{ps} OK?


>removechar,Dahlia


Esaias(lookingleft): Best of luck,{pm} Ayin.

Narrator: As each of your party members leave,{pm} you start to feel the initial pinpricks of anxiety creep up on you.


Narrator: Taking deep breaths,{pm} you head into your own tunnel.

>setexpr,Ayin,nervous


NarratorSilent: Armed with only the flashlight on your Typocrypha,{pm} you slowly inch down the corridor.


NarratorSilent: After what feels like an eternity,{pm} you encounter a fork in the path. 


Ayin: Should I just pick one randomly...?


NarratorSilent: Suddenly,{pm} you start to hear footsteps coming from one of the pathways.


>setexpr,Ayin,surprisedbad


NarratorSilent: Without thinking,{pm} you run into one of the other pathways to escape.


NarratorSilent: Your heart is pounding,{pm} you can’t think straight.


NarratorSilent: You just keep running.


NarratorSilent: And running...


NarratorSilent: .{pl}.{pl}.


>clear


NarratorSilent: You look around -{pm} the area is unfamiliar.


NarratorSilent: How long were you running for?


NarratorSilent: You check your clock -{pm} 13:55.


Ayin: I-I have to get back,{pm} where is-


>stopbgm


NarratorSilent: *rustle[b]*


NarratorSilent: ...someone is in the room with you.


NarratorSilent: You fall forward and manage to shine your light in the figure’s direction.

>addchar,Niya,0,0,right


Niya: ...!{pm} Ayin?[c]


Ayin(surprisedbad): N-Niya?


>playbgm,BGMMysterious


Narrator: Standing before you is Niya,{pm} your twin.


Narrator: They glare at you menacingly.


Narrator: It’s a look you’re all too familiar with.


Niya: .{pl}.{pl}. 


Ayin(nervous): .{pl}.{pl}.


Niya: What?{pm} No hello?


Ayin(uncomfortable): Th-that’s not...{pm} I...


Ayin: S-Sorry...


Niya(normal): Hmph. 


Niya: ...how’s Ivan?


Ayin(serious): He-{ps}uh,{pm} he’s fine.


Ayin(ohfuck): H-How’re you,{pm} Niya?


Narrator: Niya squints at you,{pm} and lets out a sigh.


Niya: I’m fine[d].


Niya: Anyways,{pm} are we going to do this?


Ayin(surprisedbad): W-What?


>stopbgm


Narrator: Niya pulls down their mask over their [e]face...


Narrator: ...and takes out their weapon,{pm} a strange-looking Typocrypha,{pm} aiming it directly at you.

[a]can probably remove 'captain's log' thing - just make normal narrator scene
[b]rustle sound effect
[c]have niya start out as masked - also need to add more details/dialog
[d]add flavor that Niya was the one going around using magic to mislead AEIOU
[e]need niya mask pose face
