Narrator: You move through the Ruins with renewed purpose.


Narrator: Unburdened by self-doubt,{pm} Esaias leads you through obscure narrow tunnels as if he’d walked those paths before.


Narrator: And for the first time since this mission began,{pm} you encounter no Demons.


Narrator: You’re not sure if this is a boon{ps} or an ominous sign of something more...

Narrator: .{pl}.{pl}.


Narrator: ...and then,{pm} finally,{pm} you see it.

Illyia: Damn.{pm} That’s it,{ps} huh? 


Illyia: How the hell are we supposed to break this thing?


Dahlia(normal): According to the briefing,{pm} Ostanes made some kind of special Typocrypha to break through the barriers.


Dahlia: It should be with the main force,{pm} so until they arrive...


Ayin: W-We need to hold here,{pm} huh...


Narrator: You take out the locator beacon,{pm} hesitating only for a moment before pressing the button.

Clarke: Congratulations on finding the First Barrier!


Clarke: Please standby -{pm} The Main Attack Team will be arriving shortly!


>removechar,Clarke


Ayin(serious): Esaias,{pm} h-how long do you think it would take the Main Attack Team to arrive?


Esaias(anxious): I do not know for sure.


Esaias(normal): This deep into the Ruins,{pm} I will not be able to get any direct communications from them until they are closer.


Esaias(lookingleft): But ideally,{pm} they should be able to retrace the markers I left behind.


Ayin(ohfuck): {c,whisper}(Esaias was doing that!?){c}


Ayin(squint): {c,whisper}(...I should’ve read the debriefing more closely...){c}


Esaias(normal): Furthermore,{pm} with the attack team’s increased size,{pm} any residual Demon presences should not cause them any major delay.


Esaias: So for now... 


Illyia(concerned): ...we just gotta wait around,{pm} I guess?


Illyia(ashamed): Tch,{pm} I was kind of hoping for a cool big battle at the end!


Dahlia(perish): Illyia!

Narrator: The ground starts to tremble.


Narrator: Indicators start going wild on your Typocrypha.


Narrator: Something’s coming...

Esaias: ...!


Esaias: Large demon force approaching...
