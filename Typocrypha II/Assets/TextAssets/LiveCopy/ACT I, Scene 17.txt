Esaias: ... We’re here.


Illyia: Damn. That’s it, huh? 


Illyia: How the hell are we supposed to break this thing?


Dahlia: Not us per say. 


Dahlia(normal): According to the briefing, Ostanes made some kind of super Typocrypha to break through the barriers.


Dahlia: It should be with the main force, so until they arrive...


Ayin: W-we need to hold here, huh...


Ayin: Esaias, were you able to get into contact with any of the other teams?


Esaias(anxious): Unfortunately, I have not been able to reach anyone else. 


Esaias: It appears we may have been the first to arrive.


Illyia(ashamed): Or the only ones...


Dahlia(perish): Illyia!


Illyia(concerned): What? Just saying it as it is.


Illyia(laughing): And anyways, after that ‘Power of Friendship’ speech, I feel like I can take on a whole army!

Narrator: At that moment, the ground starts to tremble.


Narrator: Indicators start going wild on your Typocrypha.


Narrator: They’re coming.

Ayin(ohfuck): A-A-Alright team! E-Engage!
