Adelai(2 weeks ago)[right]: Hi Ayin! Just wanted to check on you - are you feeling better?


Adelai(2 weeks ago)[right]: I was going to say we should go get pho, but Typocry-Pho got closed after the attack so we would have to find a new place.


Adelai(2 weeks ago)[right]: C’mon Ayin, let’s talk, OK?[a]


Adelai(2 weeks ago)[right]: Ayin, I’m sorry, please, can we talk?


Adelai(1 week ago)[right]: Ayin, are you home? I tried knocking on your door but nobody answered.


Adelai(1 week ago)[right]: Ayin, you can’t keep hiding away like this!


Adelai(1 week ago)[right]: I’m sorry if I said something wrong, just let’s talk about it!

Adelai(3 days ago)[right]: Do you know where you’ve been assigned yet?


Adelai(3 days ago)[right]: I actually volunteered for the Sanitization Project, although it took a lot of convincing with my dad.
