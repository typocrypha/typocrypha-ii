Narrator: You’re waiting for Adelai at the Typocry-Pho restaurant.


Narrator: She’s late.


Ayin(nervous): .[pause,0.2].[pause,0.2].


Ayin: Clarke,[pause,0.1] any updates from Adelai?


>addchar,Clarke,0,0,right


Narrator: A hologram of Clarke -[pause,0.2] the Typocrypha’s “Personalized AI Clerk” -[pause,0.2] blips into existence.


Clarke: Yes,[pause,0.1] you have received 62 new messages from Adelai Steiner in the past 10 minutes.


>setexpr,Ayin,surprisedbad


Clarke: Based on your previous preferences,[pause,0.1] I have throttled new notifications from Adelai Steiner.


Clarke: Would you like for me to re-enable notifications?


Ayin(squint): ...n-no,[pause,0.2] that’s OK Clarke.


Narrator: Adelai is a really fast typer.

Clarke: Understood!


Clarke: Summarizing recent messages...


Clarke: {c,adelai}“Some stuff came up, running late, be there soon, super super super sorry!”{c}


Ayin(nervoussmile): Got it,[pause,0.2] thanks...


Clarke: You’re welcome, Ayin.


>removechar,Clarke


Narrator: As if on cue, you see Adelai run in through the door.

>addchar,Adelai,0,0,right,frustrated


Adelai(frustrated): Oh my god Ayin I’m so sorry!


Adelai(frustrateddistant): I left right after I texted you but then the train was late and I forgot my keys and-


Ayin(nervoussmile): Uh,[pause,0.2] i-it’s OK Adelai.[pause,0.2] I saw your texts. 


Adelai: Sorry-[pause,0.2]^shake^Urgh|shake|! It’s just frustrating.


Adelai(bffs4ever): Anyways,[pause,0.1] did you already order?


Ayin(normal): Yeah, two orders of boat noodles.


Adelai(serious): And you got the sizes right?[pause,0.2] So a-


Ayin(normal): -Small for me and large for you.


Adelai(normal): Thanks Ayin!


Adelai(caring): You should treat yourself to a large sometimes!


Ayin(nervoussmile): Well money’s been kind of tight recently so...


Adelai(interested): Ah,[pause,0.3] right...


Adelai: But your dad’s been helping you with the school fees, right?


Ayin(normal): Ivan?[pause,0.2] Well as much as he can.


Ayin(sheepish): But I don’t want to burden him too much. 


Ayin: He’s been working a lot of overtime recently.


Ayin(concerned): Some days I don’t even see him come home...


Adelai: Why doesn’t he come back to work for Ostanes?


Adelai(teasing): I’m sure we could at least pay him better. 


Ayin(normal): I’ve brought it up before[pause,0.1] but he always dodges the subject.


Adelai(normal): Well,[pause,0.2] let me know if he ever changes his mind! 


Adelai: I could probably put a good word in with my dad.


Narrator: You have mixed feelings about exploiting the fact that Adelai’s dad is the CEO of Ostanes.


Adelai(frustrateddistant): Sigh...[pause,0.3] Not that I really see him that much either.


Adelai: He’s been in constant meetings with the board and AEIOU. 


Adelai: Feels like they’re planning something...


Ayin: Like what?


Adelai(normal): Oh I don’t know. 


Adelai: I try to keep my nose out of all that bureaucracy.


Adelai(serious): Although I have been seeing a lot more of aunty-[pause,0.1]err,[pause,0.1] General Agnes.


Adelai(serious): Maybe they’re planning on finally going into the Ruins and just destroying all those stupid demons...


Narrator: Adelai seems lost in thought. 


Narrator: She’s been feeling distant like this a lot recently.


Ayin(sheepish): S-so,[pause,0.2] sounds like both our dads are pretty busy, huh? 


Adelai(bffs4ever): ...hehe,[pause,0.2] yeah. 


Adelai(teasing): Hey that reminds me,[pause,0.2] do you remember that old play room at the Ostanes office?


Ayin(sheepish): Mmmaybe~?


Adelai(normal): C’mon,[pause,0.2] you remember! 


Adelai: We were always playing with each other there while our dads were working.


Narrator: Back then...[pause,0.2] Before the Demons attacked and put Agartha into lockdown.


Narrator: Ivan was one of the chief engineers for {c,ui-terms}Ostanes{c}:[pause,0.1] the inventor of the Typocrypha.


Narrator: Supposedly Ivan even worked directly with Austin Steiner at times.


Narrator: But after the Demon attack,[pause,0.1] Ivan suddenly left Ostanes.


Narrator: He never told you why.


Adelai(teasing): And speaking of waiting around,[pause,0.2] our food’s taking a while, huh?


Adelai(normal): Maybe I’ll go ask-

Narrator: [screen-shake,0.5,1.5] A large explosion shakes the restaurant and throws you to the ground.


Narrator: Once the shaking stops, your Typocrypha starts playing an alarm message.


>addchar,Clarke,0,0.2


Clarke: ATTENTION.[pause,0.2] ATTENTION. 


Clarke: Demons have attacked Residential Area B.


Clarke: Please evacuate the area immediately.


Clarke: The Exterminators are on their way to address the situation.


Clarke: Repeat, please evacuate immediately.


Clarke: ATTENTION...


Narrator: The alarm continues on a shrill loop.


>removechar,Clarke


Adelai(serious): Ayin?[pause,0.2] A-Are you OK?


Ayin(nervous): I-I... 


Narrator: A cold wave of anxiety washes over you. 


Narrator: Your arms start to feel numb and tingly.


Ayin(ohfuck): H-Haa....[pause,0.1] I’m s-sorry,[pause,0.1] I c-c-can’t...


Adelai: Ayin,[pause,0.2] look at me! 


Adelai(caring): Breathe.[pause,0.2] Breathe, Ayin.


Ayin(uncomfortable): Haaa...[pause,0.5] Haa...


Narrator: Adelai takes your hand into hers and you focus just on that warmth.


Narrator: A moment passes. 


Adelai: Have you calmed down a bit?


Ayin: Y-yeah...[pause,0.2] Sorry, Adelai.


Ayin(sheepish): I’m always h-holding you back, aren’t I?


Adelai: Of course you’re not. 


Adelai: We’re friends,[pause,0.1] right?


Narrator: You nod wordlessly, and Adelai smiles back.


Adelai(serious): C’mon,[pause,0.1] that explosion sounded really close to here. 


Adelai(serious): We better evacuate.
