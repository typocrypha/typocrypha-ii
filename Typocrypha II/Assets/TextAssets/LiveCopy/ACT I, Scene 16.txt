Narrator: You continue through the Ruins.


Narrator: Dahlia puts on a strong front, but even you can tell she’s in pain.


Dahlia: Nngh!


Ayin(surprisedbad): Dahlia! A-are you OK?


Dahlia(serious): Y-yeah... 


Dahlia(concerned): I’ll be fine...


Ayin(nervoussmile): Uh, maybe w-we can take a short break?


Esaias(normal): ...We are making good pace. 


Esaias(lookingright): I do not think a short break will set us back.


Illyia(ashamed): ...


Dahlia(concerned): Well... Fine.


>setexpr,Ayin,serious


Narrator: You all huddle around the lantern in a small sideroom.


Narrator: The orange light blends into strange hues with the glowing blue runes on the wall.


Narrator: In the distance, you think you hear sounds of battle... Or perhaps, it’s just the residual ringing in your ears.


Narrator: So close to your goal, yet already so beaten, you wonder if you’ll be able to complete your mission.

Clarke: MISSION UPDATE INCOMING. PLEASE STANDBY.


Dahlia(normal): Maybe they’ve already found the First Barrier...?


Ayin(nervous): Th-That’d be nice...


>playsfx,SFXBootup
Clarke: Receiving data[pause,0.3]. [pause,0.3]. [pause,0.3].


Clarke: First Barrier Location...[pause,0.2] UNKNOWN


Illyia(ashamed): Well, so much for that...


Ayin(nervous): B-But maybe some of the other scouting teams are close?


Ayin(serious): Clarke, d-do you have the status of the other teams?


Clarke: Pinging status of scouting team A...


Clarke: Status of scouting team A...[pause,0.2] RETIRED


Ayin(surprisedbad): Wh-What?


>playbgm,BGMExposition


Clarke: Status of scouting team B...[pause,0.2] RETIRED


Clarke: Status of scouting team C...[pause,0.2] UNKNOWN


Clarke: Status of scouting team D...[pause,0.2] RETIRED


Narrator: Without emotion, Clarke continues listing out each of the 26 scouting teams.


Narrator: UNKNOWN... [pause,0.2]RETIRED... [pause,0.2]RETIRED...


Narrator: Not a single one with a positive response.


Clarke: Status of scouting team X...[pause,0.2] RETIRED


Clarke: Status of scouting team Y.[pause,0.2].[pause,0.2].[pause,0.2] RETIRED


>stopbgm


Clarke: ...


>playbgm,BGMVictory


Clarke: Congratulations! Your team, scouting team Z, is the closest team to locating the First Barrier!


Clarke: FRIENDLY REMINDER: Deserting is a criminal offense.


Clarke: Good luck!


>stopbgm


>removechar,Clarke


Illyia(serious): Shit...


Esaias(anxious): This- There must be a mistake.


Ayin(surprisedbad): W-wait, what does this mean?


Illyia(pissed): Don’t you get it, “Leader”? 


>playbgm,BGMCurse


Illyia: It means they’re all dead! This was a suicide mission from the start!


Illyia(ashamed): “Minimal demon interference” my ass.


Dahlia(serious): What are you complaining about? I thought you wanted a fight.


Illyia(serious): A fair fight, sure! But at this rate it won’t be a fight.


Illyia(ashamed): ... It’ll be a massacre...


Esaias(lookingleft): ...I...


Esaias(anxious): I don’t want to die... I-I can’t-


Dahlia(concerned): Hey, Saia. Calm down... It’s OK...


Dahlia: M-Maybe we can fall back for now and regroup with the main attack team to get reinforcements?


Illyia(normal): Hah! Good luck with that! 


Illyia(serious): You heard Clarke, no retreat for the scouting teams!


Ayin(ohfuck): Um... I-


Dahlia(stressed): What’s your problem!?


Dahlia: YOU were the one constantly running off, making brash decisions for the rest of us!


Illyia(pissed): And if I didn’t make those choices, we’d still be going in circles getting nowhere!


Ayin: I was thinking maybe-


Esaias(anxious): I’m sorry... I-I did not know, I c-couldn’t...


Illyia(concerned): Great, and now our navigator is losing his mind!


Dahlia(perish): Illyia, you-


>stopbgm


Ayin(surprisedbad): I-I have something to say!!!


>setexpr,Dahlia,concerned


Narrator: Everyone stops to look at you.


Ayin(uncomfortable): ...Um...


Narrator: Panic starts to set in, but you remember what to do.


>playbgm,BGMSecondHand


Narrator: “Deep breaths, Ayin.”


Ayin(serious): I think... We need to move forward to find the First Barrier.


Ayin: ...


Ayin: I-I know that I’m not r-really much of a leader.


Ayin(nervous): I’m not the strongest fighter like Illyia... 


Ayin: ... a-and I can’t navigate the Ruins like Esaias... 


Ayin(squint): I can’t even do any healing like Dahlia...


Ayin(normal): But Adelai...


Ayin(sheepish): ...Ah- Adelai, s-she’s my friend on the main attack team.


Ayin(normal): She believed that I-[pause,0.2]We would be able to find the First Barrier...


Ayin(serious): ...and she promised me she’d be the one to save us once we do...


Narrator: You feel the locator beacon in your bag, feeling as heavy as ever.


Ayin(nervous): U-Um... 


Ayin(nervoussmile): I-I guess what I’m trying to say is, I need everyone’s help to do this...


Ayin(serious): And I think that together...


Ayin: ...Uh...


Ayin(ohfuck): M-Maybe we can do it and survive...?


Narrator: As you finish your speech, the whole party is looking at you.


Narrator: You subconsciously avert your gaze.


Narrator: What if you just made everything awkward?


Narrator: You feel the dark despair close in on you...


>stopbgm


Narrator: ... until...


Dahlia(serious): ...I’m in.


>playbgm,BGMBattleSecondHand


Dahlia(eyeroll): W-Well, not that we really have any other choice...


Dahlia(happy): But since we’re the last team standing, I bet we could negotiate a bonus for completing the mission!


Ayin(nervoussmile): Th-Thanks, Dahlia.


Illyia(serious): ...


>setexpr,Ayin,ohfuck


Narrator: Illyia walks up to you and starts sizing you up.


Narrator: And then with a slight smirk...


Illyia(quietlyhappy): Hmph, alright Leader. 


Illyia(ashamed): And anyways, Iris would kill me if I deserted... 


Ayin(ohfuck): Uh, for sure, y-yeah...


Ayin(serious): ...Esaias?


Dahlia(concerned): Esaias, if you don’t think you can do it...


Esaias(lookingright): ... 


Esaias: To be honest, I do still wish to run.


Esaias(normal): When I volunteered, I had thought that this would be the best way to see the Ruins in person.


Esaias(anxious): But I was naive. I see that now.


Esaias: ...Ayin. 


Esaias(normal): While I am still afraid, I will go assist you.


>stopbgm


Ayin(puppyeyes): ...


Ayin(cheerful): Thanks, Esaias.


>playbgm,BGMExplorer


Ayin: ...


Ayin(ohfuck): ...Uh, so I guess we can, um...


Ayin: {c,whisper}(Oh god I didn’t think I’d get this far what do I do-){c}


>setexpr,Illyia,laughing
>setexpr,Dahlia,laughing


Everyone: Hahahaha!


Ayin(sheepish): Sorry, I’m still not great at this..


Dahlia: Don’t worry Ayin! You may be the leader, but that doesn’t mean you have to do everything yourself!


Esaias: I agree completely. 


Esaias(lookingleft): I already have our next route planned out to maximize our ground coverage.


Esaias(normal): Ready to head out whenever you are, Leader.


Ayin(evillaugh): Alright, team, let’s go!
