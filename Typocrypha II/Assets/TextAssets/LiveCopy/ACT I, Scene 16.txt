Narrator: As you continue through the Ruins,{pm} Dahlia puts on a strong front,{pm} but even you can tell she’s in pain.


Dahlia: Nngh-!


Ayin(surprisedbad): Dahlia!{pm} A-are you OK?


Dahlia(serious): Y-Yeah... 


Dahlia(concerned): I’ll be fine,{pl} I just need a moment to catch my breath...


Ayin(nervoussmile): Uh,{pm} maybe w-we can take a short break?


Esaias(normal): .{pl}.{pl}.{pl}we are making good pace. 


Esaias(lookingright): I do not think a short break will set us back.


Illyia(ashamed): .{pl}.{pl}.


Dahlia(concerned): Well...{pm} OK then.


>setexpr,Ayin,serious


Narrator: You all huddle around the lantern in a small sideroom.


Narrator: The orange light blends into strange hues with the glowing blue runes on the wall.


Narrator: In the distance,{pm} you think you hear sounds of battle...{pm}


Narrator: ...or perhaps it’s just the residual ringing in your ears.


Narrator: So close to your goal,{pm} yet already so beaten,{pm} you wonder if you’ll be able to complete your mission.

Clarke: MISSION UPDATE DOWNLOADING.{pm} PLEASE STANDBY.

Clarke: Receiving data{pl}.{pl}.{pl}.


Clarke: First Barrier Location...[pause,0.2] UNKNOWN


Illyia(normal): Sounds like we’re still in the running!


Ayin(nervous): B-But some of the other scouting teams should be close,{pm} right?


Ayin(serious): Clarke,{pm} d-do you have the status of the other teams?


Clarke: Pinging status of scouting team A...

>playbgm,BGMVictory


Clarke: Congratulations!{pm} Your team,{pm} scouting team Z,{pm} is the closest team to locating the First Barrier!


Clarke: FRIENDLY REMINDER:{pl} Deserting is a criminal offense.


Clarke: Good luck!


>stopbgm


>removechar,Clarke


Illyia(serious): Shit...


Esaias(anxious): This-{pm} There must be a mistake.


Ayin(surprisedbad): W-Wait,{pm} what does this mean?


Illyia(pissed): Don’t you get it,{pm} “Captain”? 


>playbgm,BGMCurse


Illyia: It means they’re all dead!{pm} This was a suicide mission from the start!


Illyia(ashamed): “Minimal demon interference” my ass.


Dahlia(serious): What are you complaining about?{pm} I thought you wanted a fight.


Illyia(serious): A fair fight,{ps} sure!{pm} But at this rate it won’t be a fight.


Illyia(ashamed): It’ll be a massacre.


Esaias(lookingleft): ...I...


Esaias(anxious): I don’t want to die...{pm} I-{ps}I...


Dahlia(concerned): Hey,{ps} Saia.{pm} Calm down...{pm} It’s OK...


Dahlia: M-Maybe we can fall back for now and regroup with the main attack team to get reinforcements?


Illyia(normal): Hah!{pm} Good luck with that! 


Illyia(serious): You heard Clarke,{pm} no retreat for the scouting teams!


Ayin(ohfuck): Um...{pm} I-


Dahlia(stressed): What’s your problem!?


Dahlia: YOU were the one constantly running off,{pm} making brash decisions for the rest of us!


Illyia(pissed): And if I didn’t make those choices,{pm} we’d still be going in circles getting nowhere!


Ayin: I was thinking maybe-


Esaias(anxious): I’m sorry...{pm} I-{ps}I did not know,{pm} I c-couldn’t have...


Illyia(concerned): Great,{pm} and now our navigator is losing his head!


Dahlia(perish): Illyia,{pm} you-


>stopbgm


Ayin(surprisedbad): I-{ps}I have something to say!!!


>setexpr,Dahlia,concerned


Narrator: Everyone stops to look at you.


Ayin(uncomfortable): ...um...


Narrator: Panic starts to set in,{pm} but you remember what to do.


>playbgm,BGMSecondHand


Narrator: “Deep breaths,{pm} Ayin.”


Ayin(serious): I think...{pm} We need to keep moving forward to find the First Barrier.


Ayin: .{pl}.{pl}.


Ayin: I-I know that I’m not r-really much of a leader.


Ayin(nervous): I’m not a strong fighter like Illyia... 


Ayin: ...a-and I can’t navigate the Ruins like Esaias... 


Ayin(squint): I can’t even do any healing like Dahlia...


Ayin(normal): But Adelai...


Ayin(sheepish): ...ah-{ps} Adelai,{pm} s-she’s my friend on the main attack team.


Ayin(normal): She believed that I-{pm}We would be able to find the First Barrier...


Ayin(serious): ...and she promised me she’d be the one to save us once we do...


Narrator: You feel the locator beacon in your bag,{pm} feeling as heavy as ever.


Ayin(nervous): U-{ps}Um... 


Ayin(nervoussmile): I-I guess what I’m trying to say is,{pm} I need everyone’s help to do this...


Ayin(serious): And I think that together...


Ayin: ...uh...


Ayin(ohfuck): M-Maybe we can do it and survive...?


Narrator: As you finish your speech,{pm} the whole party is looking at you.


Narrator: You subconsciously avert your gaze.


Narrator: What if you just made everything awkward?


Narrator: You feel the dark despair close in on you...


>stopbgm


Narrator: ...until...


Dahlia(serious): ...I’m in.


>playbgm,BGMBattleSecondHand


Dahlia(eyeroll): W-Well,{pm} not that we really have any other choice...


Dahlia(happy): But since we’re the last team standing,{pm} I bet we could negotiate an even bigger bonus for completing the mission!


Ayin(nervoussmile): Th-Thanks,{pm} Dahlia.


Illyia(serious): .{pl}.{pl}.


>setexpr,Ayin,ohfuck


Ayin: .{pl}.{pl}.


Illyia(quietlyhappy): Hmph,{pm} alright Captain. 


Illyia(ashamed): Besides,{pm} Iris would kill me if I deserted... 


Ayin(ohfuck): Uh,{pm} for sure,{pm} y-yeah...


Ayin(serious): .{pl}.{pl}.{pl}Esaias?


Dahlia(concerned): Esaias,{pm} if you don’t think you can do it...


Esaias(lookingright): .{pl}.{pl}. 


Esaias: To be honest,{pm} I do still wish to run away.


Esaias(normal): When I volunteered,{pm} I had thought that this would be the best way to see the Ruins in person.


Esaias(anxious): But I was naive.{pm} I see that now.


Esaias: ...Ayin. 


Esaias(normal): While I am still afraid,{pm} I will go with you.


>stopbgm


Ayin(puppyeyes): .{pl}.{pl}.


Ayin(cheerful): Thanks,{pm} Esaias.


>playbgm,BGMExplorer


Ayin: .{pl}.{pl}.


Ayin(ohfuck): ...uh,{pm} so I guess we can,{pm} um...


Ayin: {c,whisper}(Oh god I didn’t think I’d get this far what do I do-){c}


>setexpr,Illyia,laughing
>setexpr,Dahlia,laughing


Narrator: In a moment,{pm} everyone suddenly bursts into laughter


Ayin(sheepish): Sorry,{pm} I’m still not great at this..


Dahlia: Don’t worry Ayin!{pm} You may be the leader,{pm} but that doesn’t mean you have to do everything yourself!


Esaias: I agree completely. 


Esaias(lookingleft): I already have our next route planned out to maximize our ground coverage.


Esaias(normal): Ready to head out whenever you are,{pm} Leader.


Ayin(evillaugh): Alright team,{pm} let’s go!
