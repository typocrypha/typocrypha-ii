Narrator: You are Adelai Steiner,{pm} the star rookie agent of AEIOU.


Narrator: With straight A’s in AEIOU Academy,{pm} and an impeccable field record,{pm} even senior officials try to bump shoulders with you.


Narrator: But despite your accolades,{pm} you find yourself currently completely helpless.


Narrator: You sit paralyzed by the bedside of General Kaia Agnes,{pm} deceased.


Adelai: .{pl}.{pl}.

NarratorSilent: *Knock* *Knock*


Narrator: You don’t turn to look,{pm} because you already know who it is.


>addchar,Yvonne,0,0,right


Narrator: It’s the only other person granted access to this room -{pm} Yvonne Vyner,{pm} Leader of the Iconoclasts branch of AEIOU.


Narrator: With a complete sense of irreverence,{pm} they walk up beside you next to the bed.


Yvonne: Agent Adelai.


Adelai(defeated): .{pl}.{pl}.


Yvonne: Hmph.{pm} Fine,{pm} keep moping all you’d like.


Yvonne: I granted you access to this room out of respect for your father,{pm} but seeing how childish you’ve been acting...


Narrator: You wince at their words,{pm} but cage your emotions.


Yvonne: ...I see now that was a mistake.


Yvonne[a]: But no matter.


Narrator: With a smirk,{pm} Yvonne throws a briefing packet onto a nearby table.


Yvonne: Today is the last day you are allowed to enter this room.


Yvonne: Make sure once you’ve thoroughly read your cover,{pm} you properly dispose of the materials.


Adelai(serious): Cover...?


Yvonne: Please,{ps} Adelai.{pm} Don’t make me have to spell it out for you.


>playbgm,BGMTension


Yvonne: The body lying before you is not the body of General Kaia Agnes,{pm} but of a nameless agent,{pm} unidentifiable because of serious burns.


Yvonne: The General was injured,{pm} but is now recovering while on...


Yvonne: ...indefinite leave.


Adelai(frustrated): Why?{pm} Y-You can’t just-


Yvonne: You see,{pm} Agent Adelai.


Yvonne: It’s a simple case of...{pm} Marketing.


Adelai(interested): ...!


Narrator: Yvonne begins pacing about the room as if reciting for a play,{pm} almost singing her lines.


Yvonne: General Kaia Agnes Destroys the First Barrier...


Yvonne: ...but at what cost?


Yvonne: Hundreds of agents dead,{pm} and hundreds more missing,{pm} almost half of the entire offensive!


Yvonne: Some of which were injured by{pm} *gasp*{pm} AEIOU’s own weapons!?


Narrator: You remember when the MW-Cannon went off,{pm} and the ensuing chaos...


Adelai(serious): But that was-


Yvonne: And so!{pm} For the next offensive to destroy the Second Barrier,{pm} a new General shall be selected.


Yvonne: Someone with the right knowledge,{pm} the right skills,{pm} and the right connections~!


Narrator: Yvonne merely glares at you.{pm} They don’t need to explain this one.


Narrator: Just the thought makes you sick to your stomach.


Yvonne: But thanks to my precedessor’s mistakes,{pm} it’ll take time to prepare for the next offensive. 


Yvonne: And so the secret of Kaia Agnes’s demise must remain a secret.


Yvonne: Do you understand,{pm} Agent?


>stopbgm


Adelai(frustrated): .{pl}.{pl}.


Adelai(ifonly): Of course,{pm} G-{ps}General Vyner.


Narrator: A wide grin creeps onto Yvonne’s face just for a moment before they collect themselves.


Yvonne: Excellent!


Yvonne: I expect great things from you,{pm} Adelai Steiner!


Yvonne: And make sure you’re out by 3:00pm,{pm} OK?


>removechar,Yvonne 


Narrator: Yvonne leaves,{pm} slamming the door behind them.


Narrator: Alone in the room,{pm} you desperately suppress the urge to scream.


>setexpr,Adelai,frustrated


Narrator: .{pl}.{pl}.


Narrator: You look back down at Kaia.


Narrator: It was that same Demon that did this to her -{pm} the same one you saw at Seven Stars...


Narrator: The one that almost killed Ayin...


Narrator: You know what must be done.
