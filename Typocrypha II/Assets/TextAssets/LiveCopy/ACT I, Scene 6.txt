Narrator: The two of you arrive at your house,[pause,0.2] having escaped while AEIOU fought against the Demons.


Adelai(caring): We...{pl} We made it...

Adelai(frustrated): -Ow!


Ayin(nervous): Adelai?!


Adelai(caring): I-It’s nothing.[pause,0.2] I just got a bruise on my leg.


Adelai(normal): It’ll heal up on its own. 


Ayin(concerned): L-let me see,[pause,0.1] I think I have a first aid kit somewhere around here...


Adelai: You’re not hurt anywhere?


Ayin(nervous): No,{pm} at least I-I don’t think so...


Adelai(bffs4ever): Thank goodness...


Narrator: Adelai lets out a sigh of relief,{pm} leaving a moment of reprieve before her expression turns cold once more.


Adelai(frustrateddistant): Cursed demons...{pl} Isn’t it enough that they forced us into lockdown?

Narrator: A video starts playing of General Kaia Agnes,[pause,0.2] Typocrypha still armed and ready.


Kaia: Citizens of Agartha,{ps} I am General Kaia Agnes,{ps} head of the AEIOU Exterminators.


Kaia(normal): .{pl}.{pl}.


Kaia: It has been 15 long years since the Demons of Obscurai broke the peace by attacking and slaughtering our people.


Kaia(confident): And,{pm} during this time,{pm} you have all stayed strong.


Kaia: You have stayed diligent,{pm} looking out for each other.


Kaia: You have persevered in hopes that life would one day return to normal.


Kaia(commanding): Today,{pm} that hope for normalcy has been viciously challenged by the demons and their Evil Eye.


Kaia(normal): Earlier this evening,{pm} Demons attacked Residential Area B and Seven Stars Station.


Kaia: Several casualties have been reported,{pm} and as our teams are still addressing the situation,{pm} we expect those numbers to rise.


Kaia: I fought alongside our brave first responders from AEIOU,{pm} and personally stood witness to an entirely new breed of chaos.


Kaia: And,{pm} while I am happy to say that we met this challenge with the very best of Agartha,{pm} this surely will not be the last of such tragedies.


Kaia(commanding): We,{pm} the true people of Agartha,{ps} know what must be done.


Kaia: It is time to be rid of the demons from our city once and for all!


Kaia: No more lockdown,{pm} no more hiding in our homes,{pm} no more futile attempts at peace. 


Kaia: I announce here and now the start of the {c,ui-terms}Agarthan Sanitization Project.{c} 


Kaia(normal): This project,{ps} spearheaded by AEIOU,{ps} is a clear and comprehensive plan to finally defeat the demon menace and clean out the Ruins of their evil presence. 


Kaia: Having the Agarthan Sanitization Project succeed will require a significant amount of resources,{ps} of course. 


Kaia: But by far,{ps} the most important thing we will need to succeed is all of you.


>setexpr,Adelai,Interested


Kaia(confident): For the bravest among you,{ps} for those who have something to fight for,{ps} I ask of you to help Agartha break free from the gaze of the Evil Eye.


Kaia(normal): I leave you all with a prayer for those who have lost their lives fighting against the demons... 


Kaia: ...may their souls rise high above on the Wings of Agartha...


Kaia: .{pl}.{pl}.

Ayin(concerned): .{pl}.{pl}.


Ayin(concerned): A-Adelai?

Adelai: Haven’t you ever wanted to be free from all of this?


Ayin: I...


Ayin(uncomfortable): I-I don’t know...


Ayin(surprisedbad): I’m s-scared,{pm} Adelai.


Ayin(concerned): We w-were almost killed by those Demons t-today,{pm} there’s no way I’d survive a war!
