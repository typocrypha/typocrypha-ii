Clarke: See that blue orb?


Clarke: That’s a WISP, a Demon’s purest form!


Ein (concerned): Are they dangerous?


Clarke:  They almost always run away immediately.


Ein (serious): Should I attack them?


Clarke (alert): The AEIOU strongly recommends all WISPs be terminated immediately.


Clarke (alert): Remember, citizen! The only way to truly kill a Demon is to destroy its WISP.

Adelai [1,2]: We need to run, and fast.


Adelai [1,2]: We’re just a waste of time to her.

Clarke: Ein, you need to be careful.


Clarke: The enemy is powerful enough to have a RULE.


Clarke: DEATHMATCH prevents anyone in battle from leaving until only one side is alive.


Clarke: Trying to defeat her is useless.


Clarke: Focus on staying alive with SHIELD and SALVE.


Clarke: Your only hope is that the Exterminators show up before you die.
