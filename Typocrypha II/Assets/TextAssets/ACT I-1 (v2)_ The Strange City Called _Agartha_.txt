Status
* Script Status: 2nd Draft (no review) 
* DSP status: Formatted w/ improper expressions, untested in engine
* Scriptwriter: Tino
Character List:
* Those who curse their fates. [Party]
   * EIN                         (22) they/them
   * CLARKE                (--) he/they
* Those who curse others. [Agartha]
   * ADELAI                (22) she/her
Setting List:
* Typocrypho interior
Information And Purpose:
* There’s a Lockdown caused by the Evil Eye Curse.
* It’s the anniversary of the Lockdown, so it’s been around for a while.[a]
* Balor of the Evil Eye and Gloam Knight Nemesis exist, and are a threat.
   * They may be connected to the Evil Eye Curse as the “Spawn of the Evil Eye”. Maybe.
* Relationship dynamics between Ayin, Adelai.
* Ostanes has total control over TYPOCRYPHA
Main Setup & Dramatic Question:
* How did we get from the cold open to modern Agartha
* Where are we
* Who are Ein and Adelai?




Main Focus
* Primary
* Ayin (Ein) is the main character.
* Ayin and Adelai are really good friends
* Secondary
   * The lockdown exists, and both Ayin and Adelai share the desire (somewhat naively) to break the lockdown and free Agartha (themselves)
   * Ivan is a character who isn’t here, and has a father-figure type relationship with the other two


Outline
* Ayin and Adelai are at Typocrypho for the Lockdown anniversary 
   * Proper name: 
      * Detachment Day? 
      * The Exile?
      * Agarthan Independence day?
   * The upper and mid-levels make this holiday a solemn condemning of the Demons who trapped them there, but many places in the lower levels celebrate what they have to mourn what’s lost instead of following along
   * Typocrypho specifically makes dishes from the cultures that people have been detached from when the lockdown occurred
   * Adelai and Ayin normally come here with Ivan. However, this year Ivan has been too depressed to go (as this is also the anniversary of Sinclaire’s death)
   * Adelai and Ayin enjoy this even though they are both born in Agartha as it lets them imagine what the outside world is like and this is the only time Ivan usually tells stories about Sinclaire and the times before the lockdown
   * Ivan, Adelai, and Ayin normally get all different stuff and share their food family-style
* Ayin and Adelai discuss their normal tradition of eating here, and the absence of Ivan
   * “I guess we are older now. Still, I used to look forward to his stories about the world before the Lockdown”
* Typocrypho is near the train station, and the Adrestia alert is specifically that train station.
* Ayin and Adelai leave together to do what they can
   * Why?
      * Its close?
      * They want to be AEIOU heros?

Ein (normal): (Good. She’s ok.)[b][c][d][e][f]


Ein (happy): Hey, Adelai! Thought you’d forgotten about me.


Adelai (bffs4ever): Ein, you[g] know I wouldn’t miss out on our Detachment Day[h] festivities.


Adelai (frustrated): I got a speeding ticket on the way to the station.


Adelai: And then, the Skyway was late!


Adelai: Which… shouldn’t happen.


Adelai (normal): But here I am![i]


Ein (cheerful): Glad you are.


Adelai (interested): Is your father coming this year?[j]


Ein (nervous): No. Ivan still doesn’t, uh, feel up to it.


Adelai (caring): Well, let him know I missed him again[k].


Ein (cheerful): I always do!


Ein: We just have to be sure to order enough to “accidentally” have leftovers.


Adelai (normal): Any excuse to try as much as possible on Detachment Day[l].[m]


Adelai (interested): See anything good while you were waiting for me?


Ein: Yeah! Quite a few things[n] from before the Lockdown this year.


Ein (normal): I think I’ll get the boat noodles. The owner is making them in the style of a place called Laos.


Ein (elated): The old woman that shared the recipe with them even came to help out!


Adelai: Definitely can’t pass that up.


Adelai (caring): We’ll have to go back to the kitchen and thank her after we eat.


Ein (normal): Maybe she can tell us a little bit about Laos too.


Ein (nervous): The people who remember the world outside the Lockdown are only getting older.[o]


Adelai (frustrated): There you go again, acting like we won’t break the Lockdown any day now.


Adelai (ifonly): AEIOU is so close. I can feel it.


Ein (normal): Even if the Lockdown gets broken tomorrow, we might be able to make that old lady’s day[p].


Ein (nervous): (When Ivan’s feeling up to it, he loves telling stories about the world outside the Lockdown[q].)


Adelai (normal): You’re right. We should focus on what’s happening now.


Adelai (normal): Speaking of, it  looks like they have a special pork belly topping for the pho today as well!


Adelai (normal): I think I’ll get that.


Ein (mischievous): Afraid the boat noodles will be too spicy for you?


Adelai (frustrated): Hey, you know I try my best.


Adelai: I may have a weak mouth, but it’s getting stronger all the time[r].


Adelai (normal): What do you think we should bring back for Ivan?


Ein (normal): I think he’d like -

Clarke (alert): Alert!

Ein (normal): Hold on, I’m getting an alert on my Typocypha.


Adelai (serious): I’m getting it too.

Clarke: A magical presence has breached the underground and is moving towards Agartha.


Clarke: Citizens in the lower levels are advised to stay inside while the Exterminators deal with the threat.


Clarke: Citizens around the Seven Stars shopping district should remain especially cautious and find shelter immediately.


Clarke: Typocrypha self-defense spellcasting subroutines have been enabled for all citizens in the area.

Ein (nervous): That’s right next to us.


Adelai (serious): We have to do something.


Ein: What are you talking about?


Ein: The announcement, uh, very clearly said stay inside.


Adelai: If Demons break through that close to us it won’t matter if we’re inside or not.
 
Adelai: The Exterminators won’t get here fast enough, especially with their numbers so low from the last battle with Nemesis.


Adelai: Even if we aren’t AEIOU, we have combat training. We can do something.


Ein (sheepish): (I’d qualify us having combat training with a “technically”)


Ein (sheepish): I, uh, haven’t exactly practiced combat casting much since Academy.


Ein (serious): But if you think this is the right thing to do I’m coming.


Adelai (listening intently): If you really think we should stay…


Ein: No. This is the right thing to do. 


Ein: You take the lead. I’ll cover your blind spots.


Adelai (teasing): You know I don’t have any blind spots.


Adelai (serious): But thanks.


Adelai (serious): If we even think we’ve lost control of the situation, we run immediately.


Ein: Sounds... almost like a plan.


Adelai: Let’s go.


>addchar,Clarke,0,0.2


Clarke (normal): Ein, please reconsider. If you leave this building, you will likely be slaughtered!


Ein (ohfuck): (Oof.)


Ein: Uh, Clarke that’s not very helpful.


Clarke (normal): Noted. I’ll be more supportive.


Clarke (normal): . . .[s]


Clarke (victory): Try not to get killed immediately!


>removechar,Clarke,0,0.2


Ein (serious): Not much, but I’ll take it.


Ein: (I guess we’re doing this.)

[a]May need to give precedent in cold opening to land
[b]Suggestions for wording pls
[c]Thank fuck?
[d]Thank goodness?
[e]Thank the Eye?
[f]Thank the Sun?
[g]Is the unnatural dialog worth mentioning the chara's name here?
[h]Name needs work probs
[i]Too many emotion changes
[j]Adeali is probably on a first name basis with Ivan? but this gives more context to who Ivan is
[k]"let him know I missed him again" sounds like "i miss you" rather than "tell your dad i said hi"
[l]I'm not sure what they're trying as much as possible on... ordering food?
[m]Does this line make it seem like Adelai doesn't care about Ivan?
[n]"quite a few things from before the lockdown this year" wording... too many words for me to comprehend the sentence "they're serving traditional food from before the lockdown this year" ??
[o]Add a pause or another line? Flow doesn't feel natrual
[p]"even if the lockdown gets broken tomorrow" even... feels like a funky word
[q]mention of ivan feels sudden here, could be reworded to have the thought be more natural (I miss Ivan's stories about the outside world)
[r]a weak mouth isn't a common phrase i hear so it feels odd... something about "building up my tolerance" might feel more natural
[s]Slowscroll if we can do it
