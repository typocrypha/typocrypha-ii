Ein (Nervous):
I think...we should go to that rock over there. Is that okay everyone? The coast seems to be clear…


Illyia (Serious):
Yeah. It’s clear. Just like the last shrub. And the ruins before that.


Ein (NervousSmile):
Nothing wrong with caution, right? I think we’re making pretty decent progress.


Illyia (Pissed):
Ugh, are you kidding me Ein? A fucking bureaucrat could have reached Layer 53 by now, and [a]they never get anything done!


Ein (Sheepish):
I mean maybe, but this is enemy territory! And there’s no way of knowing what’s around the next corner, right?


Illyia (Serious):
Well duh, and that’s why we’re scouting ahead in the first place!


Ein (Embarrassed):
(Can’t argue with that...)


Illyia (Pissed):
We’re supposed to be the ones taking ground and gathering information, but we haven’t been doing a whole lot of that with you in the driver’s seat!


Ein (Concerned):
Huh? I thought you came around to the party assignment after we crossed the threshold.


Illyia (Serious):
Nope. I just decided to give the composition a try because Dahlia said I’d still get a chance to show my stuff even with you as leader.


Illyia (Serious):
But clearly that’s not the case.


Ein (Nervous):
Isn’t it more important that we survive to see the mission through? What if we run into some kind of ambush?


Illyia (Concerned):
Then we deal with it! Don’t you wanna kick ass, be a hero?!


Ein (Concerned):
I don’t know if that’s the best idea, I mean they assigned me to take lead and-


Illyia (Pissed):
Oh screw the role assignment! The committee couldn’t recognize quality leadership if it kicked them in the face, and believe me I’ve tried.


Ein (Surprised):
You wha?


Illyia (Serious):
My point is that they had no idea what they were doing when they put our squad together!


Illyia (QuietlyHappy):
I say that we use our best judgement and let me take charge since you’re clearly unfit for duty.


Ein (Uncomfortable): 
But Clarke said...


Illyia (Laughing):
Pfft, what does Clarke know?


Ein (Concerned):
I mean-


>addchar,Dahlia,-0.5,0


Dahlia (Stressed):
Alright, that’s enough you two. None of this squabbling is getting us any closer to the Pillar!


Dahlia (Unamused):
I was hoping that you two could work this out on your own, but we need to make steady progress.


>addchar,Esaias,0.5,0


Esaias (Default):
I agree, this has dragged on long enough.


Dahlia (Default):
Thanks Saia. Ein, you’re the leader and that’s that. Sorry that I’ve gotta step in and all.


Ein (Uncomfortable):
Right…


Illyia (Serious):
Grgggh, fine.


Dahlia (Default):
That’s better. Ein, you should probably stay at the front.


Dahlia (Default):
Saia, do you think you could help Ein keep a lookout?


Esaias (Default):
Can do.


Dahlia (Concerned):
Is that alright by you, Ein?


Ein (Nervous):
Sure...


Illyia (Concerned):
What the?! But he’s the youngest here!


Dahlia (Unamused):
Saia’s a damn good analyst with maybe the keenest eyes this side of the threshold. Isn’t that right?


Esaias (Comfortable):
You’re too kind Dahlia.


Illyia (Concerned):
But-


Dahlia (Stressed):
We’re on the clock! Orders are orders and we’ve gotta keep moving. Shall we continue, Ein?


Ein (Uncomfortable):
Alright…


Esaias (LookingRight):
Let’s proceed.


Illyia (Serious):
Hmph.


Ein (Sheepish):
…


Illyia (Ashamed):
…


Ein (NervousSmile):
...


Illyia (Pissed):
RRGH, we’re moving so damn slow! I’m going on ahead. 


Dahlia (Concerned):
Illyia, wait!


Illyia (Laughing):
Relax, I’m just gonna do some scout work! Think of me as the vanguard or something.


Dahlia (Unamused):
But this entire team is the vanguard!


Illyia (Pissed):
Then I’ll be the vanguard of the vanguard! Whatever.


>removechar,Illyia


Ein (Concerned):
H-Hey! Illyia come back!


>removechar,Ayin


Dahlia (Concerned):
Ein don’t just run off! We’d have to catch up to you too!
