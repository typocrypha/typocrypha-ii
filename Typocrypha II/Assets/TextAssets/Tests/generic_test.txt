Narrator: Ayin and Adelai are having lunch together.

Adelai(normal): Excuse me! We're ready to order.

Waiter: Coming!

Narrator: It's a busy day in Typocrypho.

Narrator: After yelling some orders to the kitchen, the waiter rushes over to your table.

Waiter: What would you like?

Adelai: I'll have a #1 combination beef pho.

Ayin(concerned): Hmmmm.

Waiter: Um, do you need more time?

Ayin(ohfuck): Uh, s-sorry, no I, well maybe...

Adelai(caring): They'll also have the #1, medium.

Waiter: OK, thank you!

Adelai(normal): That's what you wanted, right?

Ayin(sheepish): Uh, yeah, I guess.

Narrator: You were thinking of trying something different, but oh well.
