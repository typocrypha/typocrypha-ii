Clarke: Hello, Ayin! {c,ui-terms}Operation “Raindance”{c} begins in 14 minutes and 39 seconds.


Clarke: Why have you not rendezvoused with your team yet?


Ayin(surprised): M-My team?


Clarke: You have been assigned to Infiltration Team Q.


Clarke: Listing all team members and associated roles...


Narrator: Team Q - Operation “Raindance”, Sub-Operation “Trickle Down”.\
Ayin A. - ID:NB - TEAM LEADER\
Illyia X. - ID:F - FORWARD GUARD\
Dahlia B. - ID:F - MEDIC\
Esaias W. - ID:M - NAVIGATOR\


Ayin(nervous): Wait, why am I the leader?


Clarke: Assignments were based on a comprehensive competency analysis of the personnel, taking into consideration their education, recorded combat skill, and personality.


Clarke: In your case, footage was captured of your brave fight against the demons during the Seven Stars Incident, increasing your rating substantially!


Ayin(ohfuck): ^shake^Ah...|shake|


Ayin(nervous): {c,whisper}I should’ve just stayed back and eaten my boat noodles...{c}


Ayin(serious): Um, could you also look up another person?


Clarke: Certainly!


Ayin: Adelai Steiner.


Clarke: Searching...


Narrator: Adelai S. - FORWARD GUARD. Attack Team B. Operation “Raindance”, Sub-Operation “Flash Flood”.  


Ayin(concerned): Do you know where Team B is meeting up?


Clarke: Teams A-E have already begun the descent in the Ruins to prepare for the frontal assault.


Clarke: Your team will be infiltrating through an adjacent side tunnel to attempt to sneak past demon forces to scout out the {c,ui-terms}First Barrier[a]{c,ui-terms}.


Ayin: First Barrier?


Clarke: Agent Ayin, have you read the mission briefing[b]?


Ayin(ohfuck): Uh, y-yeah! Of course, haha...


Clarke: ...Good!


Clarke: In the interest of time, I have provided your teammates with your current position. They should be arriving shortly.


>removechar,Clarke


Ayin(nervous): (I hope they’re nice...)


>addchar,Dahlia,0,0,right


>addchar,Esaias,0,0,right


Narrator: In the distance, a kind looking person and a serious looking one start moving towards you.


Narrator: The kind looking one starts waving as if you were an old friend.


Narrator: You awkwardly avert your gaze.


Dahlia(normal): Oh, excuse me!


Ayin(surprised): Uh, y-yes?


Dahlia(laughing): You’re Ayin, right? We’re your other teammates. Nice to meet you!


Dahlia(happy): I’m {c,ui-terms}Dahlia Bulsara{c}, but you can just call me Dahlia. I use she/her pronouns. 


Dahlia: And, while I’ve been assigned as the medic, I’m no stranger to fighting, so you can count on me for backup!


Esaias: I would recommend we stick closely to our assigned roles for the mission.


Dahlia(normal): Ah, you gotta loosen up, Saia!


Dahlia(sarcastic): It’s not like you’re going to be just staring at a map the whole time we’re down there.


Esaias(anxious): Actually, the layout of the Ruins of Obscurai is extremely complicated.


Esaias(lookingleft): Due to electro-magical interference, we will be unable to use any form of automated guidance when inside.


Esaias(lookingright): Furthermore, current maps of the Ruins are horribly inaccurate, and-


Dahlia(happy): OK OK, I’ll stop you right there. 


Dahlia(serious): Why don’t you introduce yourself to our new leader first, yeah?


Esaias(embarrassed): {c,whisper}... Apologies.{c}


Esaias(normal): I am {c,ui-terms}Esaias Walker{c}, Navigator. He/him pronouns.


Esaias: Please do not hesitate to ask if you require any additional information on the Ruins.


Ayin(sheepish): Uh, sure!


Ayin(surprised): ... Oh! Right, my name! You can, uh, j-just call me Ayin...?


Ayin(nervous): I, um, I use they/them pronouns...


Dahlia(laughing): Haha, you don’t have to be so nervous, Ayin!


Dahlia(normal): I mean, we’re just scouting the place out. Should be easy!


Esaias(anxious): Agreed. If you look here...


// TODO: Map appears.


Esaias(normal): Our planned path will follow along an old Obscurian aqueduct, which was abandoned thousands of years before the construction of the surrounding atria allowing us to exploit the-


Dahlia(sarcastic): Uh, Sai?


Esaias(embarrassed): ... Apologies, again.


// TODO: Map hides.


Esaias(normal): In short, we should not encounter significant demon resistance.


Dahlia(happy): See? We’ll be fine.


Ayin(nervoussmile): Y-yeah... Thanks.


Narrator: You begin to think, with these two, things might be OK after all.


Narrator: Just as you’re thinking this, another person walks up to your group. 


>addchar,Illyia,0,0,right


Narrator: They don’t look at you in the eyes, seeming to look farther into the distance.


Narrator: They kind of remind you of Adelai.


Illyia(serious): ...


Dahlia: Oh, you must be Illyia! Hi, I’m Da-


Illyia(concerned): Yeah yeah, I reviewed all of your profiles.


Illyia: Two civilian volunteers and a draftee...


Illyia(ashamed): Just my luck... 


Dahlia: ... Excuse me?


Illyia(pissed): Alright, listen up! We’re changing our planned route.


//TODO: Map appears.


Illyia(serious): From Point A, we’ll cut through Sub-Atrium D to get to the First Barrier. 


Illyia: It’ll be faster and from there we can regroup with the attack team.


//TODO: Map hides.


Illyia(ashamed): Any questions?


Narrator: You find yourself at a loss for words - partially because you didn’t really understand what Illyia just said.


Narrator: Esaias is the first to break the silence.


Esaias(whut): Er, Illyia? If I may...


Esaias(anxious): If we take that route, due to its proximity to the main atrium, we will encounter significantly more demon resistance.


Esaias: And regrouping with the attack teams was not a part of the original missi-


Illyia(pissed): What? You scared of a few demons?


Illyia(serious): Just don’t worry about it and follow my lead.


Dahlia(stressed): Hey, what’s your problem? You’re not the leader!


Illyia(normal): ... You know what, you’re right. I’m not the leader.


Illyia(serious): Me? The one with years of demon combat experience? I’m just another soldier.


Illyia(pissed): But the draftee who’s still in Academy? Of course they get to be the leader!


Dahlia: Look, that doesn’t mean-


Ayin(uncomfortable): I-I’ll give it to you!


Dahlia(concerned): !!


Ayin(serious): Illyia, you can be the leader. I’ll transfer the designation.


Illyia(quietlyhappy): Hmph, it’s good to see at least one of you has some common sense.


Ayin: Clarke, transfer role LEADER to Illyia.


>addchar,Clarke,0,0,left


Clarke: Transfer request DENIED.


Illyia(pissed): What? 


Clarke: REASON: Illyia Xiong has been put on observation per General {c,ui-terms}Iris Xiong[c]’s{c} request.


Clarke: Agents on observation are prohibited from taking team designation status of LEADER.


Illyia(serious): ^shake^Iris?!|shake| That bitch...


Illyia(pissed): First you take me off the attack team and now this?


Dahlia(sarcastic): Well well, it’s good to see that the higher ups have some common sense, keeping a tight leash on a hothead like you.


Illyia(serious): You shut up right now or I’ll-


Clarke: NOTICE: Operation “Raindance”, Sub-Operation “Trickle-Down” begins in 10 minutes. All agents please prepare to descend into the Ruins.


>removechar,Clarke


Illyia(ashamed): ...


Narrator: Without a single word, Illyia starts walking towards the Ruins entrance.


>removechar,Illyia


Dahlia: Jeez, she sure is a hot mess.


Dahlia(eyeroll): Sigh... But we shouldn’t let her go off by herself, I guess.


Dahlia(happy): Ah, and don’t worry too much about the leader stuff, Ayin. Saia and I got your back!


Esaias(whut): Agreed. I am still in disbelief that she thought cutting through Sub-Atrium D would be faster than my planned route!


Esaias(anxious): The demon interference alone would cost-


Dahlia(perish): Ahem-!


Esaias(embarrassed): -Ah... We will support you, Ayin.


Ayin(ohfuck): G-got it, thanks...
