/*Should probably be a separate message rather than narrator text*/
Narrator: DATE: 3/13 


Narrator: LOCATION: Shopping District B, Restaurant “Typocrypho”


Narrator: DEMON ACTIVITY: Low


Narrator: You’re waiting for Adelai at the Typocrypho restaurant. She’s late.


Ayin(nervous): ...


Ayin: Maybe I should call her...


Narrator: You see Adelai run in through the door.[pause,0.5] She sees you and immediately comes over.


>addchar,Adelai,0,0,right


Adelai(frustrated): Oh my god Ayin I’m so sorry!


Adelai(frustrateddistant): I left right after I texted you but then the train was late and I almost forgot my keys and-


Ayin(nervoussmile): Uh, i-it’s OK Adelai[a][b]. I saw your texts. 


Narrator: You didn’t get a chance to read them all, however - there were over 60 of them.


Narrator: Adelai is a really fast typer.


Adelai: Sorry-Urgh! It’s just frustrating.


Adelai(bffs4ever): Anyways, did you already order?


Ayin(normal): Yeah, two orders of boat noodles[c].


Adelai(serious): And you got the sizes right? So a-


Ayin(normal): Yeah yeah, small for me and large for you.


Adelai(normal): Perfect, thank you so much.


Adelai(caring): You should treat yourself to a large sometimes!


Ayin(nervoussmile): Well, money’s been kind of tight recently so...


Adelai(interested): Ah, yeah...


Adelai: But your dad[d]’s been helping you with the school fees, right?


Ayin(normal): Ivan? Well as much as he can.


Ayin(sheepish): But I don’t want to burden him too much. He’s been working a lot of overtime, as usual.


Ayin(concerned): Some days I don’t even see him at home...


Adelai: Why doesn’t he come back to work for Ostanes?


Adelai(teasing): I’m sure we could pay him better, at least. 


Ayin(normal): I’ve brought it up before, but he always tries to dodge the subject.


Adelai(normal): Well, if he ever changes his mind let me know, I could probably put a good word in with my dad[e].


Adelai(frustrateddistant): Not that I really see him that much, either.


Adelai: He’s been in constant meetings with the board and AEIOU[f]. Feels like they’re planning something...


Ayin: Like what?


Adelai(normal): Hm? Oh, I don’t know. I try to keep my nose out of all that bureaucracy.


Adelai: Although I have been seeing a lot more of aunty-[pause,0.5]err, General Agnes[g].


Adelai(serious): Maybe they’re planning on finally going into the Ruins[h] and just destroying all those stupid demons...


Ayin(nervous): Uh, y-yeah... 


Narrator: Adelai seems lost in thought. She’s been feeling distant like this a lot recently.


Ayin(sheepish): S-so, sounds like both our dads are pretty busy, huh? Reminds me of when we were kids, haha...


Adelai(bffs4ever): ...Hehe, yeah. We were always playing with each other at the Ostanes office while our dads were working.


Adelai: Speaking of waiting around, our food’s taking a while, huh?


Adelai(normal): Maybe I’ll go ask-

Narrator: [screen-shake,2,0.5] A large explosion shakes the restaurant and throws you to the ground.


Narrator: Once the shaking stops, your Typocrypha starts playing an alarm message.

Clarke: ATTENTION. ATTENTION. 


Clarke: Demons have attacked 3rd st. Ostanes Warehouse in Financial District C.


Clarke: Please evacuate the area immediately.


Clarke: The Exterminators[i] are on their way to address the situation.


Clarke: Repeat, please evacuate immediately.


Clarke: ATTENTION...


Narrator: The alarm continues on a shrill loop.


>removechar,Clarke


Adelai(serious): Ayin? Are you OK?


Ayin(nervous): I-I... 


Ayin(ohfuck): H-Haa.... I’m s-sorry, I c-c-can’t...


Adelai: Hey, Ayin, look at me! 


Adelai(caring): Breathe.[pause,0.5] Breathe, Ayin.


Ayin(uncomfortable): Haaa... Haa...


Adelai: Have you calmed down a bit?


Ayin: Y-yeah... Sorry, Adelai.


Ayin(sheepish): I’m always h-holding you back, aren’t I?


Adelai: No, I’m sorry. I forgot these sorts of things really freak you out.


Adelai: C’mon, that explosion sounded really close to here. We better evacuate.
