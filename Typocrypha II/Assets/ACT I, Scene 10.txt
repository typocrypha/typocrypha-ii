Ayin: Phew...


Esaias: Ayin,{pm} you seem to be struggling.


Ayin(sheepish): Huh?{pm} O-Oh,{pm} yeah... 


Ayin: Just getting back into it,{pm} haha...


Esaias(lookingleft): Is there a reason you do not use any {c,ui-terms}Spell Variants{c}?


Ayin(serious): .{pl}.{pl}.


Ayin(ohfuck): Uhh...


Esaias(lookingright): .{pl}.{pl}.


Esaias(normal): For example...

Esaias[0,2]: You should see your Typocrypha highlighting that Tanuki’s {c,highlight}“SPEAR”{c} Spell,{pm} correct?


Ayin[0,1]: But wait,{pm} I don’t have a {c,ui-terms}“SPEAR”{c} Spell in my {c,ui-terms}Spell List{c}...


Esaias[0,2]: That is because {c,ui-terms}“SPEAR”{c} is a Variant of your {c,ui-terms}“LANCE”{c} Spell.


Ayin[0,1]: ...what?




Esaias[0,2](lookingright): ...


Esaias[0,2](normal): Try typing in the {c,ui-terms}”SPEAR”{c} Spell and using it against that Tanuki.

Esaias: Good work,{pm} Ayin.


Ayin: Thanks,{ps} Esaias!


Ayin(sheepish): This Variant Spell stuff is pretty tricky,{pm} huh?


Esaias: It is simple once you understand the underlying properties.


Esaias: You see,{pm} your “SWORD,” “LANCE,” and “HAMMER,” Spells are known as {c,ui-terms}Base Word Spells{c}.




>setexpr,Ayin,squint


Esaias: Each {c,ui-terms}Base Word Spell has multiple Variant Spells{c} that can be used instead of the Base Word.


Esaias(lookingleft): Variants can have {c,ui-terms}different effects{c} from the Base Words,{pm} such as differing amounts of damage or area of effect.


>setexpr,Ayin,ohfuck


Esaias(anxious): [scroll-delay,0.01]Variant Spells work by utilizing the similar semantics of the Spell Words to reduce the cardinality required by the magic circuits in the Typocrypha,{pm} which in turn...


Ayin(ohfuck): {c,whisper}(I’ll just look this up in TIPS later...){c}
